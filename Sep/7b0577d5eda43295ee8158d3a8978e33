The Formula One ace admitted he is so focused on work that he’s having to plan to look for love once he retires from racing. LONDON - Lewis Hamilton has revealed he can’t get a girlfriend because he has no time for romance thanks to his “workaholic” nature. The Formula One ace - who has only casually dated since splitting from Nicole Scherzinger three years ago - admitted he is so focused on work that he’s having to plan to look for love once he retires from racing. He told The Times newspaper: “My love life is non-existent. I’m a workaholic. I don’t have time for it. When you travel as much as I do it’s hard to keep up a relationship, so I’m of the mindset that I’m not going to do that until I’ve stopped and no longer have to be single-minded.” The 33-year-old star - who hinted things could change if he met the right person - also revealed he would love to have a family one day, but only when he knows he could be “a good present dad” to any potential children. He added: “I want to have kids, but I want to be there for them - to be a good and present dad. But I’d be open to it if I happened to come across someone special.” Earlier this year, it was reported that Hamilton - who has been romantically linked with the likes of Gigi Hadid, Rita Ora and Rihanna since his split from Nicole in 2015 - has signed up to use exclusive matchmaking service Raya, where users are vetted and only allowed to join if they meet certain strict criteria. A source told The Sun newspaper: “Hamilton has been swiping a lot of socialites in London and uses it when travelling. “He’s happy being single but would like to find The One eventually.”
