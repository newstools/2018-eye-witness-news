Nkabinde says he’s stepping down after reaching a settlement agreement. JOHANNESBURG - Cedrick Nkabinde has resigned from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) after agreeing to drop complaints against his boss Robert McBride. Nkabinde says he’s stepping down after reaching a settlement agreement. Nkabinde had claimed that McBride acted unethically when he allegedly allowed forensic investigator Paul O’Sullivan to spearhead an investigation into former acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. The now-former Ipid investigator then wrote a letter to Police Minister Bheki Cele complaining about McBride’s conduct. Having withdrawn those complaints, he insists he’s not being paid to leave the watchdog. “It was a mutual understanding. They dropped the charges against me and I resigned in good faith... just an ordinary resignation based on the settlement agreement.”
