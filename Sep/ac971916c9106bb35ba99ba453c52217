JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma' s son Duduzane will now testify at the state capture commission of inquiry. But the African National Congress (ANC) says this isn't enough.

On Monday, Duduzane Zuma presented a letter to the inquiry indicating he is now prepared to testify. He had initially refused to give evidence as he's at the centre of a parallel criminal matter. WATCH: Ajay Gupta & Duduzane Zuma want to cross-examine witnesses  Several witnesses at the state capture commission implicated Zuma, his father and other senior ANC members. Eyewitness News asked the ANC’s Zizi Kodwa if the party wants to see former President Jacob Zuma also testify. He replied: “Whether you were once a president of a republic or a premier, you must be bold enough. These allegations are quite serious.

This is despite former GCIS head Themba Maseko saying that Zuma told him to do business with the Guptas, former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor saying that Zuma was aware of the Guptas' offer of a ministerial post and former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas claiming that the Guptas said they controlled the former president.
