JOHANNESBURG – The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has warned any interference with how the board exercises its powers in operational and labour matters would be a contravention of the law.

The public broadcaster announced cost costing measures which include addressing the high wage bill which its described as unsustainable. The board says its inherited an SABC in a financial crisis. The South African Editors’ Forum's Katy Skinner agrees. “We understand where this is coming from because there’s been obviously incredible mismanagement of the SABC and now the chickens are coming home to roast in terms of that.”
