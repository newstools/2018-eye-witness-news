The committee has raised concerns in the wake of the apparent suicide of a parliamentary worker on Friday. CAPE TOWN - Parliament's police portfolio committee has ordered a thorough investigation and a review of South African Police Service (SAPS) security at the national legislature which is a national key point. The committee has raised concerns in the wake of the apparent suicide of a parliamentary worker on Friday. The 57-year-old man allegedly shot himself in his office. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman said: “The committee is very concerned regarding the incident at Parliament. It raises serious questions about operational procedures in place because Parliament is a national key-point and the incident highlights weak access control and security screening.” Beukman says the national police commissioner will be called to Parliament to explain the lack of proper security measures.
