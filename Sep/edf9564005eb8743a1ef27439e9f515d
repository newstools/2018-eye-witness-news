Relatives say they are still finding it extremely difficult to accept that their “happy baby” was snatched away and killed. Family spokesperson Mncedisi Mgidlana said: “[He was a] lovely boy even in church everybody did love that boy.” It's not yet clear when and how the toddler was killed. The 32-year-old boyfriend of little Oyingcwele's aunt, Mzimhle Jikwana, faces charges of abduction and murder appeared at the Athlone Magistrates Court on Monday. The woman had an argument with her boyfriend last Sunday and after the man left their home, the child could not be found. Jikwana's case has been postponed to next week for bail information.
