KIMBERLEY - South Africa won the toss and sent Zimbabwe in to bat in the first one-day international at the Diamond Oval on Sunday. JP Duminy, standing in as South African captain for the injured Faf du Plessis, said the record favoured teams batting second in Kimberley. "There is a little bit of grass cover and we'll try to use that up front," he said. Fast bowler Dale Steyn, who has not played in a one-day international since October 2016, was not included in the starting line-up but is likely to feature later in the three-match series. South Africa fielded a largely inexperienced batting line-up with Du Plessis and Hashim Amla injured and David Miller and Quinton de Kock rested.
