He says issues concerning the police, corruption and state capture will be addressed head-on during the campaign. “Team South Africa includes every single South African who wants to join us in building our country of our dreams, no matter how big or small your contributions are.” The DA leader says also on the agenda is breaking down state-owned-enterprises. “We must make sure that we build our cities to create sustainable infrastructure and support small businesses to thrive. This is our agenda for change.” Maimane says the DA is going to make sure there's fair access to job opportunities for all. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
