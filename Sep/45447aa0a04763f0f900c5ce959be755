At least 180 people died from the food-borne disease earlier this year.

At least 180 people died from the food-borne disease earlier this year. The source of the outbreak was identified as two Enterprise foods facilities, one in Polokwane and the other in Germiston. New food safety guidelines for the ready-to-eat food industry are now being sharpened up. In a written reply to a parliamentary question several months ago, Aaron Motsoaledi said that a number of departments and regulators reviewed their existing food control systems.
