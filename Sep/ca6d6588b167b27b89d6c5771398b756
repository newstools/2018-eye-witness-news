A total of 29 police men and women were killed between April 2017 and March this year. JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Bheki Cele  says cop killings should be seen as crimes against the state equal to treason. Cele was speaking at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Sunday during a commemoration for officers who lost their lives on duty. A total of 29 policemen and women were killed between April 2017 and March this year. Cele says anyone who takes the life of an officer is taking on the whole of South Africa. “Anybody who kills an officer must run and run but know very well that [they] will be found by us. And I’m calling on all police, don’t be kind when you find police killers.” National Police Commissioner Khehla Sithole has described police murders as an attack on the sovereignty of the state. Cele says cop killers must never rest easy. “Anyone that kills a police officer must know that you have taken the nation on, and you have declared war against the nation. And you must definitely have sleepless nights.”
