Since joining City from Atletico Madrid in 2011, the 30-year-old Argentine has helped the club win three Premier League titles and three League Cups. LONDON - Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him at the Etihad Stadium until 2021, the Premier League club said on Friday. Since joining City from Atletico Madrid in 2011, the 30-year-old Argentine has helped the club win three Premier League titles and three League Cups. Aguero is City’s all-time record scorer with 204 goals, including the stoppage-time winner against Queens Park Rangers in 2012 that won a first top division title in 44 years. "I am happy for this additional year," Aguero, who has scored three league goals in five games this season, told the club website here “My idea was being here for 10 years. I’ve been here for seven years, it’s going to be 10 when the contract expires. “Hopefully, that’s going to happen. This was the main reason I signed.” Aguero has previously said he would like to end his career at boyhood club Independiente but has postponed his return to Argentina by extending his stay at City until after his 33rd birthday. He joins Kevin De Bruyne, Fernandinho, David Silva, Nicolas Otamendi and Ederson as first-team players to have signed new long-term deals in recent months.
