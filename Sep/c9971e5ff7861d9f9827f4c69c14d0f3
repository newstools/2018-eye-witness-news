The investigation will focus on claims that two projects in February 2014 were unauthorised, wasteful and irregular. Municipal spokesperson Zweli Dlamini says they will cooperate with the probe. “In an instance where people are found to have done something wrong, they must face the full might of the law. That is our stance and we’re saying we’re not going to protect anyone and that is why we’re committing to fully cooperate with the SIU.
