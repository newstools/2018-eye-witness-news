JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) fears a hammering at the polls as the economy continues to struggle. The party has called for an aggressive approach in implementing a recovery plan with the country slipping into a technical recession this week, thanks to poor economic growth over the past several months. The ANC’s Enoch Godongwana, who heads up the party's sub-committee on economic growth, says they're not happy going into an election year with the country in a recession. He's reiterated calls for South Africans to band together to spark growth. “We’re also going into a job summit next month. We call on both government, labour and business to make concrete proposals on how to deal with growth and job creation.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
