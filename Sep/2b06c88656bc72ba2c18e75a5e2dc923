The party says it has been bombarded with calls, messages and emails from beneficiaries who have been turned away because the agency cannot capture biometric applications. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has demanded a meeting with the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) acting CEO Abraham Mahlangu over allegations that some qualifying grant beneficiaries are being turned away from their offices. The party says it has been bombarded with calls, messages and emails from beneficiaries from Gauteng and across the country who have been turned away because the agency cannot capture biometric applications. DA Shadow Minister for Social Development Bridget Masango says some people have been waiting since June to access their grants, and that if not fixed, the data capturing issues could reach crisis levels by end of September. Masango says Sassa needs to explain what the problem is. “At the end of the day, we’ll have a backlog of new applications, which can even lead to a crisis. We’ve had enough crises at Sassa, we don’t need another one which looks like it’s been manufactured.” SASSA DENIES DA CLAIMS Sassa has denied the DA’s claims that the agency is turning away qualifying grant beneficiaries from their offices because it cannot capture biometric applications. The agency, however, has admitted that it is dealing with a backlog of applications due to a labour related matter. Provincial spokesperson Nandi Mosia for the agency says the backlog is a result of some employees who refuse to do the capturing of the applications because they feel they need to be paid for the work. Mosia says they have instituted contingency measures in place. “We have put systems in place to make sure that people are not turned away anymore. We are trying our best [and] we just have a backlog with those that have been turned away, but now we are moving with it.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
