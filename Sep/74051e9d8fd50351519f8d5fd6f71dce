CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has reportedly nominated himself as the Western Cape Premier candidate to replace Helen Zille. A briefing for the party's premier candidate was due to be made on Sunday, however, it has been postponed. The Sunday Times is reporting that Maimane’s decision is an admission that the da stands little chance to win next year's general elections. Maimane's spokesperson Portia Adams says the announcement will be made later this week. “This is to be combined with the announcement of the successful candidate for the Mayor of the City of Cape Town.”
