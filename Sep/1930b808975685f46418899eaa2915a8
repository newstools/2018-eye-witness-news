Provincial ANC's Sochayile Khanyile says this is a great way to honour mama Winnie. JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in Gauteng has kicked off a week of remembrance for late struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. To celebrate mama Winnie's birthday on Wednesday the party announced the launch of Winnie Mandela food gardens, a community project and a feeding scheme at children's homes in Soweto. Madikizela-Mandela passed away earlier this year at Netcare Milpark hospital at the age of 81. Provincial ANC's Sochayile Khanyile says this is a great way to honour mama Winnie. “So that we can use these gardens to provide for the poor, to start a programme to ensure that we take care of those who are going through problems of poverty. Those are the programmes that were planned for the period.” (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
