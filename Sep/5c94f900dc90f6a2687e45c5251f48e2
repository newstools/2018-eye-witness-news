JOHANNESBURG - As Saturday marks the start of the long weekend the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has called on motorists travelling far to be vigilant and to make regular stops. The RTMC says it’s extremely concerned about two major bus crashes on the NI highway in Limpopo this week in which 20 people were killed. On Friday, at least nine people died, including a child, when the bus they were travelling in from Zimbabwe overturned. On Monday, 11 commuters died when their bus crashed on the same road near Mokopong. The RTMC’s Simon Zwane says preliminary investigations have shown human error played a major role in Friday’s crash. “We have to step up visibility to ensure that there is support for drivers along the road, and identify those that are at risk of accidents and assist to make sure that loss of life is minimised.” ‘TIGHTEN REGULATIONS’ The Limpopo government has called on the national Transport Department to tighten road safety regulations at borders. Limpopo government spokesperson Kenny Mathivha says drivers are too tired when they enter the country's borders. “Maybe we should have checks and balances at the borders, like the Musina border coming into South Africa, is the one of the busiest in the country. So driver fatigue and all other things that come with the safety of vehicles, so traffic officers need to do check and balances.” (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
