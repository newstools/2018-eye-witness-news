He obviously is in a hurry to clear his name. So he has made a request that the committee speedily deals with this particular matter and support him on this call." ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says he welcomes Smith’s willingness to subject himself to the Ethics Committee of Parliament to clear his name. Mthembu says the party's caucus is inspired by the strong sense of integrity and political accountability displayed by Smith. Mthembu says he will now consult the party's political committee about Smith's request to step aside as a committee chairperson. The committee will sit next week Wednesday to consider Smith's request. No date has yet been set for the Ethics Committee sitting. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
