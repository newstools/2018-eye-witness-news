Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa says negotiations have deadlocked with Sibanye-Stillwater, Harmony Gold, and Village Main Reef. JOHANNESBURG – The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) is threatening to cripple the gold sector. Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa  says negotiations have deadlocked with Sibanye-Stillwater, Harmony Gold, and Village Main Reef. The union is looking for a R1,000 annual increase for this year while employers are offering R625. LISTEN: Amcu takes mines to CCMA  Mathunjwa says the employers are negotiating in bad faith. “These guys, they are looting the monies that are supposed to go to the workers. Sibanye has been killing workers, they have had two disasters which even today no one is accountable for. They save costs in terms of safety [by] taking shortcuts, [they’re] making super profit, [and] workers languish in poverty.” ‘NUM SHOULD JOIN GOLD SECTOR WAGE TALKS’ Mathunjwa has called on the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) to join forces with it in the gold sector wage negotiations. The Amcu president has lambasted the latest offer put forward by mining companies, calling it an insult to workers. Mathunjwa says if Amcu were to join forces with NUM, employers would have no choice but to agree to their demands. “NUM and Amcu in the gold sector can shut this shaft just for 14 days. It will send a very good signal that the working class is moving forward [and] they are progressive.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
