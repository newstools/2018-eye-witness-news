JOHANNESBURG - On what would have been Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s 82nd birthday, the City of Johannesburg says it would like her name to gain more prominence in the city. The liberation icon died in April this year after a lengthy illness. She was posthumously conferred with the Freedom of the City Award on Tuesday. The city says it has plans to name the city’s buildings and streets after Madikizela-Mandela. Council Speaker Vasco da Gama explains: “Community development will go through a public participation process and the public will be put forward their suggestions on what should carry whose name.” He says they've decided to bring another motion forward to have the council chambers named after the struggle icon. Da Gama says the conferment of Freedom of the City Award to Madikizela-Mandela is the beginning of many other honorary events.
