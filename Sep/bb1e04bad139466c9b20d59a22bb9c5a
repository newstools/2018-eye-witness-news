Ramaphosa says shortages of supplies at hospitals are being urgently addressed. “Funding is being made available immediately to buy beds and linen and the minister of health will immediately fill 2,300 critical medical posts, including nurses as well as medical interns. This is an urgent need that we’re addressing through this whole intervention.” WATCH: Ramaphosa announces economic stimulus package  STIMULATE GROWTH The government's newly unveiled economic stimulus package will inject much-needed capital into agriculture as well as the township and rural economies.
