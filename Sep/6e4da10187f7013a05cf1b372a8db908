JOHANNESBURG - Maritzburg United have confirmed that midfielder Keagan Buchanan will be out for several months after sustaining an ACL knee injury in training. Buchanan who recently signed for the KZN-based side during the offseason from Kaizer Chiefs has struggled with injuries in his career before and this is yet another injury blow for the 26-year-old. Maritzburg United head coach Fadlu Davids says losing Buchanan is a major blow for the side. “It's a blow for us to lose him. It happened at training, [he] will have a scan today to determine the extent of the injury. But it's definitely an ACL, maybe not a complete rupture, either grade 2 or 3, which will put him out for a couple of months.” Maritzburg are due to play table-topping Bidvest Wits at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday.
