He says the divisions of the past have been rearing their ugly heads to threaten national unity. JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President David Mabuza  has urged the country to unite in celebration of Heritage Day. Mabuza addressed a large crowd in Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday afternoon during the official Heritage Day celebration. He says the divisions of the past have been rearing their ugly heads to threaten national unity. “It is understandable that human beings are prone, in times of national strife, in times of bitter socio-economic hardship, in times of hard debates about land reform, to retreat easily into narrow nationalist, racial and ethnic enclaves. “However, I stand in front of you on this day to state with conviction that this path we have chosen, is the correct one. It is the path that will unite our nation and one that will help us to forge a common nationhood.” Earlier, Mabuza unveiled the statue of the leader of the Griqua people Adam Kok in Kokstad.  ‘THERE’S ENOUGH LAND TO SHARE’ Mabuza also used his Heritage Day address to assure South Africans that there's enough land to go around in the country. His statement comes at a time where Parliament is expected to give a recommendation on whether to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation. Mabuza says the country must work towards a just and equitable system when it comes to land reform. “Ours is a land of abundance. It can provide for everyone. There is enough to go around, enough to share, enough to end poverty, deprivation and all forms of want. All we must do is live up to our potential under a just and equitable system. This is what our common heritage means.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
