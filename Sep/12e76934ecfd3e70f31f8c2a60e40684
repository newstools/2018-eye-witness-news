JOHANNESBURG - The Sinoville Crisis Centre says it is devastated by Tuesday's Constitutional Court ruling decriminalising the use of dagga by adults in private. The Pretoria-based NGO assists people with various issues including drug abuse and domestic violence. The centre says its concerned about the possibility of dagga becoming a gateway drug for other narcotics.
