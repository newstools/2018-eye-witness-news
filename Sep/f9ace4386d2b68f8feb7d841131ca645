Dams feeding the City of Cape Town have reached 70% capacity. CAPE TOWN - The average dam levels in the Western Cape has increased to 64%. During this time last year, dams were only 35% full. Environmental Affairs MEC spokesperson James-Brent Styan said: “We are also grateful to see that the Theewaterskloof Dam which provides the bulk of Cape Town’s water is standing at 56%. That’s the largest dam in the province. Towards the end of April this year, the dam was below 10% and rapidly emptying, so it is quite a turnaround that we’ve seen over the winter season and early spring.” Meanwhile, dams feeding the City of Cape Town have reached 70% capacity. From 1 October, water restrictions will be relaxed from Level 6b to Level 5. Level 5 will include prohibiting residents from irrigating using municipal water and with a maximum showerhead flow rate not exceeding more than 10 litres per minute. This will usher in revised water tariffs that will bring further relief for residents. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
