The Presidency's Khuselo Diko says they support Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo's appeal to people with information to come forward. “It’s [the commission] bringing to the fore the information that may have been concealed for a period of time. And as the Presidency, we continue to urge all those with information that may assist in the investigation to come forward and make sure that they present their testimony before the commission.” WATCH: Ajay Gupta & Duduzane Zuma want to cross-examine witnesses
