Trade union Solidarity says the company deployed staff that do not have the necessary clearances and certifications to work on there. JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Solidary  says the Sasol  steam plant in Sasolburg is being run illegally. This comes after union members in Sasolburg joined striking workers’ in Mpumalanga in response to Sasol's employee share ownership plan that excludes white workers. The union's Dirk Hermann says that the plant should have been shut down on Saturday morning but it continued with operations. He says the company deployed staff that do not have the necessary clearances and certifications to work on there. “Nobody that can run that plant is legally at work at this stage, Sasol is still running the plant and Solidarity has written to the Department of Labour. We believe it can have huge risks for the rest of Sasolburg as well.” Meanwhile, Sasol refutes claims that its plant in Sasolburg is operating illegally. The company says they do not agree that conditions at its plant are unsafe and that there is no indication that safety has been compromised. It says that it activated a contingency plan after its staffs embarked on a strike. The company says it holds views that all its employees have the right of recourse on any concerns or problems that may arise with the company and it will not do anything to intimidate them.
