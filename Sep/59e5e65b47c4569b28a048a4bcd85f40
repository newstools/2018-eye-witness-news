Sri Lanka's airline spokesman said it has responded by clearing its stock of cashews, only served in business class, and would change its Dubai-based supplier. COLOMBO - Sri Lanka's national airline said Wednesday it has stopped serving cashews after the country's president flew into a rage over nuts served to him on a flight to Colombo. "Returning from Kathmandu, I was served some cashews on board a Sri Lankan flight, but it was so bad even a dog wouldn't eat it," Maithripala Sirisena said on Monday. "I want to know who authorised the purchase of these nuts," the president told a meeting of farmers. An airline spokesman said it has responded by clearing its stock of cashews, only served in business class, and would change its Dubai-based supplier. This is not the first time that airline nuts have prompted outrage. In 2014 a South Korean heiress famously ordered a Korean Air plane back to its gate to eject a cabin crew member after she was served nuts still in their packet. Last month, Colombo renewed its search for an equity investor in the loss-making and heavily indebted Sri Lankan after the International Monetary Fun d warned that the airline was dragging the country's economy down. In May last year, attempts to privatise the carrier collapsed after a US private equity firm withdrew its bid for a 49% stake. The airline was profitable before Mahinda Rajapakse, when he was president, cancelled a management agreement with Emirates in 2008 following a personal dispute. The carrier had refused to bump fare-paying passengers and give their seats to Rajapakse's family. Rajapakse removed the Emirates-appointed chief executive of Sri Lankan and made his brother-in-law Nishantha Wickremasinghe head of the company. Wickremasinghe is now under investigation for corruption and mismanagement.
