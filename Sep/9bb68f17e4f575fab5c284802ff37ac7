CAPE TOWN - A woman has been shot dead and her 10-year-old child injured after suspected gang members opened fire in Westbury. It’s understood three men were shooting at each other near the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital on Thursday afternoon when the woman was killed. One man involved in the shooting was injured and is now in police custody. The police's Lungelo Dlamini said: “We are busy interviewing him to establish who are those other people involved in the shooting. At this stage, we don’t know the motive for the shooting.” The child remains in a critical condition in hospital. Dlamini said: “Three men were involved in the shooting and while they were shooting at each other a woman who was passing by was shot and killed.” Meanwhile, a woman says her son was shot and killed two months ago in front of a Westbury school. She says police have done nothing to help the community with the crime. “You go to the police station and find out how many murder dockets they have and what happened to those dockets, nothing. The last murder conviction that I know of in Westbury was a child that was killed on his mother’s lap.”
