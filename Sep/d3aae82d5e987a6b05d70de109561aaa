The commission was set up two years ago to investigate political killings in KwaZulu-Natal since 2011. DURBAN – KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu has officially released the Moerane Commission report to the public. The commission was set up two years ago to investigate political killings in the province since 2011. Mchunu has noted that “weak political parties and leadership is what leads to factionalism and intolerance within and between parties, which in turn results in violent conflict.” Mchunu tabled the report in the provincial legislature on Thursday afternoon where he called on all political parties to take responsibility for the killing of politicians. The premier has expressed government's commitment to implementing all the recommendations of the report. Mchunu says the only thing that will cause a delay in the enforcing the suggestions is the discussions that still need to take place with various sectors such as civil society, business and political parties.
