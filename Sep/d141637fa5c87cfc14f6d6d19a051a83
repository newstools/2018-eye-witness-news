Cedrick Nkabinde resigned from Ipid on Friday after agreeing to drop complaints accusing his former boss Robert McBride of unethical conduct. JOHANNESBURG - Former Ipid investigator Cedric Nkabinde has denied he's leaving the watchdog for a position in the South African Police Service. Nkabinde resigned from Ipid on Friday after agreeing to drop complaints accusing his former boss Robert McBride of unethical conduct. Nkabinde had claimed that McBride acted unethically when he allegedly allowed forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan to spearhead a probe into former acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. Nkabinde has also denied being paid to leave Ipid. “I heard it has always been said that I was offered a position, which is a lie. It is not true. The only thing I did was apply for a lateral transfer back to the SAPS because I was no longer comfortable in the situation I was in at Ipid.” The former investigator insists he is leaving as part of a mutual agreement and that he was not pushed out.
