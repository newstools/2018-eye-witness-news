CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has warned water guzzlers that if they continue to consume high levels of water, they will be targeted for the installation of a water demand management device. On Monday, the municipality announced that it would lower water restrictions and tariffs from Level 6B to Level 5 from October due to the encouraging dam recovery. Residents using between zero and six kilolitres will see a decrease of 26.6%. The tariff for those using above 35 kilolitres will be reduced by 70%. Mayco member for water Xanthea Limberg says that Level 5 does provide a reduction in the cost of water, adding that high consumption still comes at a punitive cost. “Even though the percentage drop seems significant, the point remains that consumption is still at rand value.” She adds that even under Level 5 residential tariffs, residents are not supposed to be consuming water above 10 kilolitres.
