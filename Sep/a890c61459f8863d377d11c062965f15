JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Bheki Cele has reassured citizens that if a loved one goes missing they don't have to wait before reporting the case to authorities. Cele was speaking on the sidelines of a memorial service held at the Rippon Primary School in KwaZulu-Natal where slain nine-year-old Miguel Louw was in grade four. Louw was kidnapped and murdered allegedly by a man known to his family in July. His body was found in a shallow grave near his Phoenix home last week and DNA tests confirmed his identity on Wednesday. Cele says the family has told him they were ill-treated by police while trying to report his disappearance. “I want to remind the nation that the 48-hour wait because somebody is missing before it’s reported, it's gone - that thing does not exist.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
