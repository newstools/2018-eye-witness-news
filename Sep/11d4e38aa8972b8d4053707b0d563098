The City of Johannesburg has partnered with the Global Citizen to clean up the streets with the aim of improving the environment, cutting plastic use and embracing a healthy lifestyle. Mayor Herman Mashaba brought his ‘A Re Sebetseng’ initiative over the weekend and joined hundreds of other residents in cleaning up the city's streets. Those in attendance had the opportunity to win some general access and VIP access tickets to the Global Citizen Festival which will see the likes of Beyoncé, Jay Z, Cassper Nyovest, Femi Kuti, Sho Madjozi, Tiwa Savage, Usher and Wizkid perform live on 2 December at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. Join the #AReSebetseng team on the third Saturday of each month and you could also win tickets to the festival. If you missed this past weekend’s clean-up, you can catch it again on 20 October and 17 November. Just in case you're wondering what your chances of winning the tickets are, this past weekend there were over 800 participants with over 50 ticket winners in all four regions.
