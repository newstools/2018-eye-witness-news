In recent years, there have been several crashes on the road during this period many of which were attributed to speeding and the use of unroadworthy vehicles. JOHANNESBURG - Motorists on the N1 highway between Gauteng and Polokwane are being urged to remain patient and drive cautiously as thousands of people travel to the Zion Christian Church (ZCC)'s headquarters in Limpopo for their annual year-end pilgrimage. In recent years, there have been several crashes on the road during this period many of which were attributed to speeding and the use of unroadworthy vehicles. Traffic towards Polokwane will be affected on Saturday. The Limpopo Transport Department's Matome Moremi-Tauyatswala said: “Those who will be traveling from the N1 north from Gauteng and Limpopo must exercise a high level of discipline and patience as the traffic flow might slow at the toll gates. Our traffic officers will be available to monitor all the major roads on a 24-hour basis assisted by the national police.” ZERO-TOLERANCE APPROACH Limpopo police say they will continue implementing a zero-tolerance approach as ZCC worshippers make their year-end pilgrimage to the church's headquarters in the province. Police say there have been fewer crashes than at this time last year and they will continue to monitor the province's highways. Moremi-Tauyatswala added: “Limpopo remains a zero-tolerance zone for those who do not obey the rules of the road. Our officers will continue to discharge their duties without fear or favour in an effort that motorists arrive alive.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
