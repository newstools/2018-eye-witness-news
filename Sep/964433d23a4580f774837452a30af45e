Minister Malusi Gigaba announced amendments to the visa regulations on Tuesday morning. JOHANNESBURG - The Home Affairs Department says it will simplify the rules of the travel for foreign national children. Minister Malusi Gigaba announced amendments to the visa regulations on Tuesday morning. These amendments are in line with recommendations by the inter-ministerial committee on immigration regulations. Gigaba says the changes follow concerns raised by the tourism sector. The minister says an international travel advisory will be issued next month to announce the changes affecting children. “The key changes will be that rather than requiring all foreign nationals who are minors to carry documentation which proves parental consent and certificates of birth, we will rather strongly recommend that the parents of these minors carry the documentation.” Gigaba says travelling South African minors are still required to prove parental consent when travelling outside the country. Gigaba says parents should prove relation with minors. "These changes will be implemented ahead of the festive season. We’ll also train immigration officials on the revised regulations to ensure smooth implementation." (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
