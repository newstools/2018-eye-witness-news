The bill was approved by the National Council of Provinces last month and sent to the president to be signed into law. Oliphant says the president is currently going through the bill. “In terms of the protocol, you have to invite constitutional representatives to advise him whether it’s within the Constitution before he signs.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
