Unions still haven’t reached a deal with Sibanye-Stillwater, Harmony Gold and Village Main Reef. JOHANNESBURG – The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) and Solidarity  have signed a three-year wage agreement with Anglo Gold Ashanti. The agreement provides for a salary increase of 6,5% for year one of the agreement and 6,5% or Consumer Price Index (CPI) - whichever is higher - for each of the following two years for miners, artisans and officials. It also provides for a salary increase of R1,000 per annum for the next three years for category four to eight employees along with an increase of R100 a year on the housing allowance. Solidarity's Gideon du Plessis said: “The offer is way above the inflation rate. And secondly, the offer for entry-level workers is also very favourable and will bring the workers very close to the R12,500 minimum wage.” Unions still haven’t reached a deal with Sibanye-Stillwater, Harmony Gold and Village Main Reef. Talks with those companies will resume later this week. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
