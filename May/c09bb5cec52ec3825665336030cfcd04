Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant says the legislation will address the working conditions of South Africa’s labour force. CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly has passed a series of labour bills including the contentious National Minimum Wage Bill. The other two are the Basic Conditions of Employment Amendment Bill and the Labour Relations Amendment Bill. The minimum wage was due to be implemented on 1 May but that was postponed to give members of Parliament more time to finalise it. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant has described the labour bills as groundbreaking. She says the legislation, and in particular the National Minimum Wage Bill, will address the working conditions of South Africa’s labour force. “It’s significant that South Africa will join several countries around the world that have implemented the National Minimum Wage as an instrument of economic and social development.” Some opposition parties opposed the National Minimum Wage Bill, saying it’s unsustainable, unaffordable and will lead to job losses. DA MP Michael Bagraim expressed concerns. “I refer to the fact that our Treasury has stated that the minimum wage will lead to a further 750,000 job losses.” The bills will now be sent to the National Council of Provinces for concurrence before being signed into law.
