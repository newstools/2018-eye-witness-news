JOHANNESBURG – The South African Federation of Trade Union (Saftu) says it will intensify its fight against the national minimum wage bill now that it’s one step closer from being signed into law. Members of Parliament on Tuesday passed the contentious bill following months of discussions public hearings and protests from some unions. Saftu led a national march last month, expressing its dissatisfaction with the minimum wage of R3,500 per month or R20 an hour. The union's Moleko Phakedi says they are planning a two-day national strike against the bill soon. “We’re going to convene what we call a working class summit to talk to the attacks that have been directed at the working class within the Republic. “We’re going to have two to three days strike action in bringing about government to realise that workers in the republic and working class at large will not fold their arms when they’re being attacked.” The Basic Conditions of Employment Bill and the Labour Relations Amendment Bill were also passed in the National Assembly on Tuesday.
