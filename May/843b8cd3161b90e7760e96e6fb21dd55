The deputy president will answer questions from MPs on government’s intervention in the troubled North West province which is currently without a premier. CAPE TOWN – Deputy President David Mabuza is back in the hot seat to face Members of Parliament (MPs) in parliament today. Mabuza will start in the National Assembly where he will answer oral questions from MPs on a range of issues. Then on Thursday, he will face members of the NCOP where he will deliver his annual address to the upper house of parliament. Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema joked last week that he would be filing a missing persons alert for the deputy president who is affectionately known as “DD”. This was prompted by Mabuza’s low profile of late, with some speculating that he had taken ill. But Mabuza, who addressed the funeral of late photographer Sam Nzima on Saturday, will be back in Parliament this week. Mabuza will answer questions from MPs on government’s intervention in the troubled North West province which is currently without a premier. He will also be quizzed on the findings of the High-Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation among others, which will culminate in his address to the NCOP on Thursday.
