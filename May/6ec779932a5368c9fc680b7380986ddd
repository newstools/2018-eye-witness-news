IEC Commissioner Bongani Finca made it clear the plans, as they stand, don’t cater for early elections. CAPE TOWN – The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) will meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday to discuss the timetable for the looming national and provincial elections. The IEC says it is ready to hold the elections at any time between 8 May and 7 August next year. It expects an announcement on the date to be made some time in February or March. However, its plans don’t take into account the possibility of early elections being called, Parliament’s Home Affairs committee heard on Tuesday. IEC Commissioner Bongani Finca made it clear the plans, as they stand, don’t cater for early elections. “The presentation we’ve made has not factored in the dissolution of Parliament and the calling of an early election.” Commission chairperson Glenn Mashinini would not be drawn when tackled by reporters after the meeting. “I don’t know where the early election question comes from.” He’s confirmed that the IEC will meet with Ramaphosa tomorrow. Mashinini says the IEC will be ready to hold elections any time from 8 May next year. “Anything else, it’s no longer an electoral administrative matter, it’s a political matter and we would not want to be drawn into that.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
