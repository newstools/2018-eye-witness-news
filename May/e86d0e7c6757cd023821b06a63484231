'Eyewitness News' revealed last week that investigator Cedrick Nkabinde had accused Robert McBride of unlawful and unethical conduct. JOHANNESBURG - Police watchdog Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has served a notice of intention to suspend a senior investigator who has been accused of turning on Robert McBride. Eyewitness News revealed last week that investigator Cedrick Nkabinde had accused Mcbride of unlawful and unethical conduct. However, McBride says Nkabinde is among several members who've allegedly been offered jobs by the police in order to frustrate the case against former acting National Police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. Ipid's Moses Dlamini confirmed Nkabinde has been given time to explain why he should not be suspended. “At this stage, we do not want to get into all the details surrounding the intentions to suspend, but these emanate from allegations that he committed misconduct and brought the department into disrepute and the matter is going to be investigated.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
