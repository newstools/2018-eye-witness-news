JOHANNESBURG - Staff at the Alexandra Community Health Centre in Johannesburg, where a patient was stabbed to death, have described frightening and chaotic scenes as people ran from the attackers. It’s understood the patient was being treated in the emergency room when the attack by a group of unknown men took place on Saturday evening in full view of other patients and staff. The facility was reopened on Monday after police investigations. The group had apparently been fighting with the man outside the centre and followed him inside. Visibly shaken staff have not been able to speak to Eyewitness News on the record. One worker cried inconsolably as she tried to recount what happened. Facility manager Ellen Masupa says staff have been receiving counselling since the crime. “The moment the staff called me I called my community manager - who called other managers. Our chief directors and everyone were on their toes about it.” It's not clear why the man was attacked and no arrests have yet been made.
