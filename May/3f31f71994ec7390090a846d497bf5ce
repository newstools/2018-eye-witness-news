The property mogul is accused of strangling Susan Rohde at the SpierHhotel in Stellenbosch in 2016, but he claims she committed suicide. CAPE TOWN - Alleged wife killer Jason Rohde says he takes full responsibility for having an affair but insists he did not kill his wife. The property mogul is accused of strangling Susan Rohde at the Spier Hotel in Stellenbosch in 2016, but he claims she committed suicide. The court has heard how the couple fought because the accused’s mistress was also attending the work function at the hotel that weekend. Rohde tells the court he’s guilty of being an adulterer and destroying the lives of his three children and his deceased wife’s family. The accused says he takes full responsibility for this and will have to live with the shame. He, however, denies murdering his spouse of 23 years. Rohde says the option for him was divorce and not murder. He tells the court that while he has made many mistakes, he’s not a murderer. He says when he sees his children, he looks at them knowing that he’s guilty of having driven their mother to take her own life. The State disputes this and is out to prove that Susan was murdered, and evidence was tampered with to make it seem as if she hanged herself.
