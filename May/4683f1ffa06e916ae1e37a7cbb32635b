ABIDJAN - South Africa is among 26 countries that have committed to the establishment of the concept of a single African air transport market. The announcement was made by African Union  chair Moussa Faki Mahamat during a ministerial working group on the matter in the Togolese capital, Lome, on Monday morning. South Africaâ€™s Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Luwellyn Landers arrived in Togo for the 107th Session of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP) Council of Ministers, as well as the 43rd Session of the ACP-European Union (EU) Joint Council of Ministers. On the agenda is the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, which makes provision for duty-free, quota-free trade for member states into the EU. But it expires in less than two years. Talks will seek to review the partnership and how the global south stands to benefit further. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
