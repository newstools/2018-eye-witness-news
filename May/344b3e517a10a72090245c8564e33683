JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa has reacted to the killing of a patient at the Alexandra Community Health Centre, calling it senseless. It is understood that the patient, who was in the emergency room, was stabbed to death by a group of unknown people on Sunday, in full view of other patients and staff. The provincial Health Department says that a nurse was attending to the man at the time of his murder. Spokesperson Khutso Rabothata says the health centre has been closed while police investigate. “We’re in the process of doing all the cleaning and other things because the place as full of blood and make sure that it’s prepared for opening.” Earlier this month, a man died after he was assaulted with a steel drip-stand, allegedly by a psychiatric patient at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.
