Following a surge of violence this weekend, the WC transport MEC says officers will be deployed to hot spots which include, Delft and Langa. CAPE TOWN – Law enforcement officers and the South African Police Service (Saps) will be stationed at various taxi ranks around Cape Town on Monday, following a surge in violence this weekend. Nine people have been killed in taxi-related violence across Cape Town over the past 48 hours. Three more have been shot and wounded, including a commuter. The Western Cape transport MEC Donald Grant has been in talks with Saps, law enforcement agencies, and the taxi industry to discuss this weekend's violent clashes. Grant says most the violence stems from Delft. He has given taxi associations the opportunity to take part in specially convened hearings with the transport sector tomorrow to get to the root of the issues, and find a solution. Police officers and other officials will maintain a close eye on taxi ranks in Delft, Wynberg, Langa, Claremont, and the Cape Town station deck, especially on Monday. Grant says: “We will be focusing on, as per General Jula’s instruction to our law enforcement agencies, on the host spots and those particular routes where there has been bloodshed.” Meanwhile, the police say detectives are investigating the taxi-related murders and attempted murders, but no further arrests have yet been made other than of the two suspects linked to shootings near the Wynberg taxi rank on Friday. A taxi driver was shot and wounded in this incident. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
