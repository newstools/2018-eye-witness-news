The union says its almost 5,000 members at Sassa will not report to work next week after talks broke down between the two over a tabled wage demand. JOHANNESBURG - The Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) says its members at the South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) will go on strike next week Friday over a salary dispute with the agency. The union says its almost 5,000 members at Sassa will not report to work next week after talks broke down between the two over a tabled wage demand. The PSA says it is aware this strike will hit the most vulnerable members of society, and it is, therefore, urging employers to return to discussions. PSA national manager Reuben Maleka said: “Housing and danger allowance, leave provisions and other conditions of services. Since receiving a certificate of non-resolution at the CCMA on 23 April, the employer has not bothered to respond to our demand.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
