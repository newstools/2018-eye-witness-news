The rail operator says the rate of people trespassing on trains has become increasingly worrying. JOHANNESBURG - Metrorail says it loses an estimated R175 million every year in Gauteng as a result of fare evasions. Prasa's new interim board has been conducting a site visit to Metrorail train services in Johannesburg. The rail operator says the rate of people trespassing on trains has become increasingly worrying. Metrorail's acting provincial manager Goodman Matampi said: “The last time we had a stop-and-check operation only about 5% of the full train which takes about 1,800 people had tickets. Now you tell police to lock them up but they don’t have the capacity to lock up such transgressors.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
