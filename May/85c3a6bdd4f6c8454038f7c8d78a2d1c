The testimony of Juanita Pieters has been adjourned and the matter will resume on Tuesday. CAPE TOWN - The mother of murdered three-year-old Courtney Pieters has broken down on the stand while testifying. Her testimony has been adjourned and the matter will resume on Tuesday. Earlier, Mortimer Saunders pleaded guilty to poisoning the girl but insisted it was not pre-meditated. Juanita Pieters has been unable to continue her testimony. The mother of the murdered girl was also vomiting outside court. She was the State's first witness in the trial against Saunders.  Saunders is accused of raping and murdering Courtney in Elsies River in May last year. The accused rented a room in the same house the three-year-old and her family lived. Saunders has on Monday also admitted to necrophilia but he has denied raping the child before killing her. But the State has refused to accept the accused's admissions, which means two not guilty pleas will be entered into the record.    (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
