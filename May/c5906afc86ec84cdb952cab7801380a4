The DA tried to terminate De Lille's party membership and remove her as mayor following remarks she made on the 'Eusebius McKaiser Show'. JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has admitted that the party has always believed that embattled Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille was guilty of allegations against her. This is despite the DA instituting a disciplinary hearing against De Lille, supposedly to test claims of maladministration and fraud. The DA tried to terminate De Lille's party membership and remove her as mayor following remarks she made on the Eusebius McKaiser Show. The Western Cape High Court reinstated her pending her challenge of the constitutionality of the DA's cessation of membership clause. Talk show host Eusebius McKaiser asked Maimane what De Lille did wrong. "One, she interfered with the Municipal Finance Management Act, the act that governs how municipalities are run, by interfering in the appointment of a senior manager." He says the party believes that this and other allegations against De Lille are a matter of fact. "When I got transcripts of that SMS, to me, that is sufficient interference, unless I must then sit there and say 'no someone said she did this and I must go on rumours.' It's not true."
