CAPE TOWN - The Mitchell's Plain Community Policing Forum cluster has introduced a new tagging system to prevent fake news from circulating on social media. The body says that over the past few months, false voice notes and text messages have been circulated amid protests and community violence. A WhatsApp message caused some panic in Mitchell's Plain during the recent protests but it turns out that it was fake news. The community policing forum's Rafique Foflonker says many residents have been raising concern over false messages on social media. Foflonker says the 3S tag system works by asking those reporting incidents to identify themselves, the source and other details. "We are hoping to reduce the volume of fake news and old news that is causing chaos, fear and panic in the community. We'd like to look at this as a mechanism to transform our society to be more responsible and more intelligent when it comes to social media news and information." Te cluster has already started using the system and is encouraging residents to buy into it.
