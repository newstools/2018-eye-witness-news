JOHANNESBURG - Black Leopards will be back in the Absa Premiership for the 2018/19 season after they beat Jomo Cosmos 1-0 in their Promotion/Relegation match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday. Lidodaduvha finished the promotion/relegation series top of the table after claiming two wins and two draws, accumulating eight points in the process. In an entertaining match in front of a packed Thohoyandou Stadium Leopards, created most of the chances early on. Karabo Tshepe capitalised after a loose pass from the Cosmos players inside their half, to bury the ball in the back of the net for a 25th minute goal. Tshepeâ€™s goal proved to be the winning goal as Leopards held on for victory. Leopards had previous contested in the promotion playoffs in 2013/14, 2014/15, 2016/17 before eventually being promoted in the 2017/18 season. The result means that Cosmos will remain in the National First Division, while Platinum Stars will join Ajax Cape Town as the two relegated teams from the PSL.
