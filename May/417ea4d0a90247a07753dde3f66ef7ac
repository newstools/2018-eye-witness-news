Five party members in prominent leadership positions in various DA-run municipalities in the Western Cape have lost the confidence of their caucuses over the past few months. CAPE TOWN – The Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says public representatives need to be held to account to ensure stability in municipalities. Five party members in prominent leadership positions in various DA-run municipalities in the Western Cape have lost the confidence of their caucuses over the past few months. The most high-profile of these officials is Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille who squares off against the party next month to challenge the termination of her party membership. De Lille, Matzikama mayor Rhenda Stephan, Stellenbosch council speaker Donovan Joubert, Berg River former mayor Evert Manuel, and Knysna's former deputy mayor Peter Myers have all had their DA caucuses lose confidence in them for various reasons. Manuel resigned as mayor earlier this week, while Myers was removed by his council in October. Stephan and Joubert still have their jobs, although the DA's federal executive will decide whether to show them the door at a meeting next month. Eyewitness News asked Maimane whether he's worried that such matters could affect the party's chances at the polls next year especially since the Western Cape is its crown jewel. “We’re not a party that says when people don’t do their work, we will shift them to administration or whatever. “We hold our public representatives to work, and undeniably going forward we felt that as a party we have to ensure that we bring stability to municipalities and we continue to deliver services.” The De Lille matter will be heard before a full bench of the high court on 4 June.
