The two boys, both now aged 15, planned to shoot and kill pupils and teachers at a school in North Yorkshire. LONDON - Two teenage boys have been found guilty of attempting to copy the infamous Columbine school shooting in the United States. The boys from a northern England school, who were 14 years old at the time, were said to have hero-worshipped the two American students who killed 13 people and themselves at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The two boys, both now aged 15, planned to shoot and kill pupils and teachers at a school in North Yorkshire. They can’t be named for legal reasons but have been found guilty of conspiracy to murder. The court was told they’d become fascinated with the Columbine shooters and plotted to deploy explosives and researched how to make a bomb. Police found petrol and a bag of screws hidden in an abandoned shack used as a hide-out and the older boy had kept a kill list underneath his bed. The younger boy told a teacher he needed to eliminate people at the school as they were infecting the gene pool. Both will be sentenced later. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
