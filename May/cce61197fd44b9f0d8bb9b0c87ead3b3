Cash Connect chief executive Richard Phillips says the only way to get a grip on cash-in-transit heist is to re-establish the justice cluster priority committee. JOHANNESBURG - While the cash-handling industry has committed itself to doing everything it can to crack down on heists, the government has been asked to make cash crimes a policing priority. The call was made at a cash van robbery panel discussion in Sandton on Thursday. Cash Connect chief executive Richard Phillips says the only way to get a grip on cash-in-transit heist is to re-establish the justice cluster priority committee. He says this would allow all the components of the criminal justice system to work towards a common cause. “It has to be a coordinated approach, so you have Crime Intelligence, State Security, National Prosecuting Authority and the courts all working as a cohesive, collective force to address the priority crime.” The latest figures reveal there have been more than 140 cash-in-transit heists since the start of 2018.
