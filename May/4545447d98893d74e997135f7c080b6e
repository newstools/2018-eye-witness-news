Eyewitness News understands that the three names submitted by the ANC in the North West are former Premier Supra Mahumapelo’s allies. JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC)’s national executive committee has rejected the three names submitted by its structure in the North West for the premiership. The party held its national executive committee meeting this weekend where they discussed who should take over the reins of premier after Supra Mahumapelo resigned last week following widespread protests against his leadership. Eyewitness News understands that all three names submitted by the ANC in the North West as candidates to be premier are Mahumapelo’s allies. It is understood that Mahumapelo has supported former Education MEC Reverend OJ Tselapedi to replace him. The Provincial ANC structure submitted the name of acting provincial secretary and current Speaker Susan Dantjie to also be considered as premier. The third name they submitted was that of North West Agriculture MEC Manketso Thlape. Thlape is a known ally of Mahumapelo and is alleged to have presided over widespread corruption in the department. The ANC NEC says they want to further consult on the matter before a premier is appointed. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
