The van was attacked while it was on its way from Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth. JOHANNESBURG - A cash-in-transit van escaped an attack by armed men during an attempted heist near Kinkelbos in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday night. The van was attacked while it was on its way from Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth. According to the police report, two vehicles attempted to box the cash delivery van in near Nananga. About nine armed men in a Nissan NP300 bakkie opened fire on the van from behind while a silver VW Polo attempted to slow the van from the front. The driver of the cash van managed to push the bakkie off the road. The van, after losing a tyre, made it to the Kinkelbos police station. None of the security guards were hurt in the attack. Police later recovered the bakkie used in the attack.  In the last month, there have been at least ten cash-in-transit heists across the country.
