The salary adjustments over the three-year deal range between 6% and 7%, depending on the employee's level and include a restructured housing allowance. PRETORIA - The Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC) says it's still waiting for about a third of union members to decide whether they'll agree to government's wage offer. The salary adjustments over the three-year deal range between 6% and 7%, depending on the employee's level and include a restructured housing allowance. Negotiations concluded about two weeks ago. While some unions rejected the deal outright, others have gone back to their members for a mandate. The PSCBC’s Frikkie de Bruin says about 42% of unions have signed the wage agreement. “About 30% of them rejected the agreement. So we’re waiting on about 35% to declare if they’re going to accept the offer on the table.” He says the parties have until 19 June to decide whether to accept the deal. De Bruin says if the agreement is not supported by the majority, they will have to go back to the negotiating table. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
