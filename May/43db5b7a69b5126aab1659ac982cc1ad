VBS was put under curatorship in March after illegally taking deposits from municipalities and hitting a liquidity crisis. CAPE TOWN - Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago is expected to announce a commission of inquiry into VBS Mutual Bank soon. His deputy, Kuben Naidoo, has told Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance the inquiry will not only consider possible fraud and corruption within the bank but will also look whether regulators and Treasury “were asleep at the wheel”. VBS was put under curatorship in March after illegally taking deposits from municipalities and hitting a liquidity crisis. An extensive forensic investigation is now underway after evidence was uncovered of a host of irregularities, while nearly R1 billion is missing. Naidoo says VBS Mutual Bank lied about the R470 million it was supposed to have as its minimum capital requirement. He says it was only after the curators went in that it was found there was “nothing”. But he says questions about whether regulators dropped the ball are legitimate. “Yes, it is the full intention of the governor to appoint a commission to see what went wrong.” Naidoo says VBS was warned about its looming cash-crunch last September, but instead increased the value of municipal deposits from about a billion to a billion and a half. “Again, the bank lied to us.” Naidoo says the commission of inquiry will be established under the Financial Sector Regulation Act, which will allow for scrutiny of the role played by regulators and Treasury, as well as acts of fraud and corruption.
