JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says his organisation remains strong and united in the face of reports that the party is on the verge of a split. Maimane was speaking on Talk Radio 702  on Wednesday morning following a City Press article which claimed some senior DA members were plotting to form a breakaway "true liberal party". But Maimane says the DA will not split. “I don’t think there’s any validity to it. As I’ve been going around provinces to meet respective structures, I think the DA is strong, united and focused on delivering for South Africans and building one South Africa for all.” LISTEN: Maimane on DA challenges  The paper also reported that the move, by at least five members of Parliament, follows tensions over race, transformation and other policy positions. On Tuesday in Parliament, DA MP Alan Mcloughlin also addressed the claims. “To those of our critics who predicted a rift in the party or dissent in the ranks, all is well in the Democratic Alliance. All you are seeing is us preparing for an election.” On Sunday, the DA released a statement, describing the media report as “nothing more than rumours and gossip”. “These fictitious ‘senior leaders’ are not even mentioned once in the story but comments from the CEO of a think tank seeking to give these rumours importance.” The DA emphasised it’s united and focused on the 2019 elections.
