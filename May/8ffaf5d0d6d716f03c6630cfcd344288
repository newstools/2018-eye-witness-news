A case of crimen injuria has been opened against a woman accused of using racial slurs on Facebook in the aftermath of the Ashwin Willemse incident. CAPE TOWN - A case of crimen injuria has been opened against a woman accused of using racial slurs on Facebook in the aftermath of the Ashwin Willemse incident. Willemse had walked off set during a live panel discussion on SuperSport last weekend after accusing his co-presenters, Nick Mallet and Naas Botha of partonising him. A community group called the Khoisan Defiance Campaign has now opened a case against a Queenstown woman, who felt the need to comment on the issue. The group's Sammy Claassen: "The perpetrator referred to coloured people as 'hotnots' and 'bobbejanne' [baboons]. We have obtained information on her whereabouts and we've asked police to treat it in the same way as they treated the Vicki Momberg case." Laaiplek police have confirmed a case of crimen injuria has been opened. The suspect has since deleted her Facebook account.
