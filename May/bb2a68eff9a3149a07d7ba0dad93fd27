Verulam residents have told Eyewitness News that the Imam Husain Mosque is not only one of the few Shia mosques in KwaZulu-Natal, but it was progressive in how it approaches women’s rights and gender equality. The Hawks have also said the crime has elements of extremism which they are now investigating. Meanwhile, the family of Essop has described their loved ones caring nature. “He was the type of the person that would give his life for the weak. He resented bullies and that’s exactly what he did,” says his brother Farouk Essop. Afzaal Sayed, who was one of the first on the scene after the attack, has made a plea to the South African government. “We are looking forward to government to taking this seriously. We want peace.” Abbas Essop was buried last night as per Islamic burial rites.
