University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo says so far, the strike has been peaceful, but there have been reports of intimidation on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - A strike by workers and academic staff at the Walter Sisulu University is affecting teaching and learning on all its campuses. University management and unions representing the staff have reached a deadlock in negotiations about a wage increase. Employees are demanding an 8% increase, while management is offering just over 6%. University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo says so far, the strike has been peaceful, but there have been reports of intimidation on Wednesday. “Intimidation of staff members that are not part of the union and have declared that they are not in support of the strike. They were forcibly removed from their workstations at one of our campuses and we’re obviously very unhappy with that because it is within their rights to not participate in the strike.” Tukwayo says exams - which are supposed to start next week - have been affected. “It has affected the exam schedule. Students were supposed to start writing exams in June. A lot of students are continuing with their studies in preparation for when we can officially resume normality with the university, but no teaching is taking place.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
