The overall budget is R47.7 billion, with a big focus on upgrading informal settlements and basic services. CAPE TOWN - Opposition parties have rejected the City of Cape Town's tabled budget for the 2018/19 financial year. The overall budget is R47.7 billion, with a big focus on upgrading informal settlements and basic services. The ANC's Xolani Sotashe says none of the public submissions supported the budget. "No, we reject the budget because if we look at the project, it's the same old project that we had 3/5 years ago. Most of the projects that were mentioned today, was that of the 2012/2013 financial year." Nearly R2 billion has been allocated for transport and urban development and a further R1.1 billion has been set aside for energy. The EFF's Andrew Arnolds says the budget doesn't cater for the poor. "We have a problem with the DA in terms of the instability and the lack of good governance in the City of Cape Town. We didn't support the budget because it is burdening the people." The majority of council approved the budget, with 139 members in favour and 66 against.
