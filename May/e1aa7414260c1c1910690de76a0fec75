In April the Eastern Cape ANC councillor was found guilty of smashing a glass jug over the head of Rano Kayser during a chaotic Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting in 2016. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) councillor Andile Lungisa has been sentenced to an effective two years behind bars for assault. He was found guilty of smashing a glass jug over the head of a former mayoral committee member, Rano Kayser, during a chaotic Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting in 2016. Kayser sustained multiple injuries during the attack. Lungisa has been handed a three-year sentence, with one year suspended for five years. The National Prosecuting Authority’s Tshepo Ndwalaza says, “We understand that they will be appealing the sentence. We, as the NPA, are satisfied with what has happened in court.” ‘AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT’ Several opposition parties have reacted to the sentence. The DA’s Eastern Cape spokesperson Mlindi Nhanha says it’s important that public representatives found guilty of brutality and criminality are held accountable. “We’re not in a celebratory mood because we’ve lost a young, vibrant and promising politician. However, we understand where the magistrate was coming from.” The Patriotic Alliance’s Marlon Daniels has labelled the entire incident as unfortunate. The United Democratic Party’s Mongameli Bobani adds they accept the court’s findings. “The magistrate studied the evidence that was presented to him. It’s a lesson to all public representatives, that we must be positive examples to our communities and the people that we serve.“ (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
