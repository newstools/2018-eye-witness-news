The agricultural industry association has found the highest numbers of farm attacks occurred from 2001 to 2002, but after that, there was a downward trend. JOHANNESBURG - AgriSA has released a report showing that farm attacks  have decreased to their lowest level in more than 20 years. The agricultural industry association says it’s based its information on statistics released by the police minister in Parliament over the past six years. The association has found the highest numbers of farm attacks occurred from 2001 to 2002. But after that, there was a downward trend. AgriSA’s director for Rural Safety and General Affairs Kobus Visser says these statistics are significant because farm attacks have long-term negative effects on the agricultural sector. “It’s a government’s responsibility to secure the environment for all our people living in South Africa to be safe. A lot of time is being spent by farmers in meetings and in organising themselves to prevent farm attacks and farm crime.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
