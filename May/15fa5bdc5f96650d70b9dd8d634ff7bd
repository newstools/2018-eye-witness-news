CAPE TOWN - A new initiative aimed at speeding up interventions to help child abuse victims has been launched. The Western Cape Social Development Department will be rolling out its “Eye-on-the-child” programme. The department's Sihle Ngobese explains how it works. “The minister announced the adoption and roll out of the eye-on-the-child programme in the Western Cape. Social development will roll out the programme by building a network of volunteers who are recruited, vetted, trained, and of course paid a stipend, to act as an early warning system to spot children at risk,” he said.
