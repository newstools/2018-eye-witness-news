JOHANNESBURG - Police have arrested a suspect after he allegedly attacked a man with a panga at the Bedford centre. It’s understood an argument broke out between the suspect and his ex-wife earlier on Wednesday. The man then allegedly assaulted the woman before pulling the panga on another man, who is believed to be his son-in-law. The police's Andre de Jager said: “The suspect was arrested and taken to Bedford Police Station. The victim was taken to a local hospital for treatment. The investigation will continue.” An eyewitness explained what happened during the attack. “It seems to have been an altercation between a father and his son-in-law, as he stepped in to protect his mother-in-law from his father-in-law’s assault. The father-in-law thereafter attacked his son-in-law… He cut him in the head and it went through his scull. It was a very bloody scene.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
