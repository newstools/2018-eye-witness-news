The Hawks say as soon as documents and electronic equipment have been examined, the matter will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a final decision. The MEC’s spokesperson James-Brent Styan said: “MEC Bredell would like to urge officials and public representatives in all our municipalities to remember their duties and responsibilities and also urge the public to report any suspected wrongdoing with the knowledge that it will be acted upon.”
