There have been a number of heists over the past two weeks. CAPE TOWN - The Hawks has given itself until the end of next June to put those responsible for cash-in-transit heists behind bars. There have been a number of heists over the past two weeks, with two taking place on Monday. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said: “It needs us as law enforcement agencies to work together. We’ll need to rope in the security industry as well. They’re aware that we’re after them.” In Centurion, a cash-in-transit security guard was shot and wounded during an attack on a cash van on Monday. It's understood at least four gunmen ambushed the van as it arrived to collect money at the Celtisdal Shopping Centre. During a separate incident in Polokwane, criminals used explosives to blow up the cash-in-transit vehicle and made off with an undisclosed amount of money early. One of the security guards, who was in the truck at the time of the crime, was injured and has been hospitalised. No arrests have been made yet. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
