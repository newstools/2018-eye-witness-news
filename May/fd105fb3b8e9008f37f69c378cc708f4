Sibonelo Mkhize is one of three men involved in a shootout with the father of a 9-year-old girl who died after being caught in the gunfight. DURBAN - The man accused of being part of a foiled deadly hijacking in Shallcross, Durban has appeared in the dock for the first time on Wednesday. Sibonelo Mkhize is one of three men involved in a shootout with the father of a 9-year-old girl who died after being caught in the gunfight. Sadia Sukhraj was laid to rest on Tuesday. The second suspect was found dead on the scene while the third criminal is still on the run. A limping Mkhize made his way into the courtroom with visible blood stains on his green jersey.  Unlike normal first court appearances, this one took a significant amount of time because Mkhize’s Legal Aid lawyer, Anele Mveku, pushed for the 32-year-old to be moved from the Durban Central Police Station. Mveku detailed to Magistrate Mohammad Motala how her client has been assaulted by cops at this particular station in a heavy-handed attempt to get a confession. Mkhize was also beaten by members of the community on the day that he was arrested. The accused is facing two counts of murder and a charge for theft and kidnapping. Mkhize has been granted his request to have him moved and will stay at the Westville prison tonight. He’ll then be accompanied by investigating officers to verify his home address and then apply for bail on Thursday.
