Sukhraj died in hospital after she was caught in the gunfight between her father and three hijackers. DURBAN – The man believed to have shot and killed nine-year-old Sadia Sukhraj is expected to appear in the Chatsworth magistrates court on Wednesday morning. The grade four pupil died in hospital after she was caught in the gunfight between her father and three hijackers. One suspect died, a 39-year-old has been arrested and their accomplice is on the run. Twenty people accused of public violence in the aftermath of Sukhraj’s death are also expected to appear in court this morning. Around 1,000 demonstrators burnt tyres and threw objects at the local police station on Monday evening, demanding more arrests and action to deal with crime in the area. Earlier that day the grade four pupil was shot in the stomach during the gunbattle. Questions remain about whose gun fired the bullet that killed Sukhraj. She later died in hospital and was laid to rest by thousands of mourners on Tuesday afternoon.    It was the sound of this bagpipe that ushered Sukhraj’s casket out of the Christian Revival Centre before being taken to her final resting place. She’s been described as a diligent pupil a child who loved family and deeply spiritual. As tensions in the community remain, authorities are urging residents to refrain from resorting to vigilantism. Today, Police Minister Bheki Cele will visit Chatsworth in a fact-finding mission and to pay his condolences to the Sukhraj family. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
