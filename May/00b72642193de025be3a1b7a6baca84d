Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa says some companies can afford R12,500, but opt for large dividends as opposed to paying workers a decent living wage. JOHANNESBURG - Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) president Joseph Mathunjwa says the national minimum wage of R3,500 is the same as a slave’s salary and has reiterated his call for a minimum wage of R12,500. President Cyril Ramaphosa has on Tuesday supported the minimum wage, saying it is a start but conceded that it is not enough. Mathunjwa says some companies can afford R12,500, but opt for large dividends as opposed to paying workers a decent living wage. Speaking on 702 on Tuesday afternoon Mathunjwa says workers in Marikana demanded R12,500 already in 2012, and now six years later R3,500 is a slap in the face of workers. “R12,500 as a minimum wage is achievable. We cannot go back and say R3,500 should be endorsed as the minimum wage in South Africa.” Amcu members snubbed Tuesday’s Workers’ Day celebrations after making a call to have 12 August to be declared a public holiday in commemoration of the 34 striking mineworkers killed by police in Marikana.
