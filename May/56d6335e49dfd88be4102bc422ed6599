Pieters admitted she told the investigating officer she didn’t know Saunders because she didn’t want to believe it was him. CAPE TOWN - The mother of murdered three-year-old Courtney Pieters has on Tuesday admitted to lying to police about knowing Mortimer Saunders. The self-confessed killer has on Tuesday apologised to Juanita Pieters and she has told the court she has forgiven him. Saunders, who lived on the same Elsies River property as the girl he killed, has admitted to her murdering her in May 2017, but he says it was not premeditated and he denies he raped her. The State has refused to accept the admissions, which means two not guilty pleas have been entered into the record. VIDEO: Mortimer Saunders pleads guilty to murder  Juanita Pieters has admitted she lied to the investigating officer the first time he showed her photos of CCTV footage showing Saunders near the place where her child’s body was discovered. She was shown the pictures at the Elsies River Police Station shortly after Courtney’s body was discovered near factories in Epping industria. Looking at exhibits of the same photos in the dock on Tuesday, Pieters admitted she told the investigating officer she didn’t know Saunders because she didn’t want to believe it was him. She says she didn’t expect him to be capable of her child’s murder because he was a quiet person who loved children and appeared to love her three-year-old daughter very much. Pieters says the accused’s daughter - who lived close by and was a few years older than her own daughter - came to play almost every day. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
