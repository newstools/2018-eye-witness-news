The party is facing several legal challenges and factional fights in many of its provincial structures. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC)’s national executive committee (NEC) has called for a meeting to discuss the state of its structures all over the country. The party is facing several legal challenges and factional fights in many of its provincial structures. The party says it’s satisfied with the progress made in the highly contested KwaZulu-Natal,  where eight of the 11 regions are in good standing. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule says they have now given a deadline for when all regional and provincial conferences must be held. “We urge all branches, region and provincial structures whose mandate have expired or about to expire to convene their conferences and conduct them in a spirit of inclusion before the end of July.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
