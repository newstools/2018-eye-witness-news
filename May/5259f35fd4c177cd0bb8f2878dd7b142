Prasa is just one state-owned enterprise that's been marred by maladministration. JOHANNESBURG – The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa)’s new interim board has hit the rails running. Board members are touring Metrorail  facilities in Johannesburg on Monday. Prasa is just one state-owned enterprise that's been marred by maladministration. The rail operator is also facing problems with ageing infrastructure, vandalism, and cable theft.  Prasa's Nana Zenani says the rail agency’s board members are on a fact-finding mission. “[This tour is meant] to show them exactly what commuters and Prasa are seeing on the ground in terms of the challenges and so that we can work together in terms of how we resolve our issues and what is critical, and so on. This is basically a fact-finding mission for the board.”  (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
