The lobby group says that Jacob Zuma was the only president who put the needs of the African native first, through implementing free education and radical economic transformation. DURBAN - A pro-Jacob Zuma lobby group says that the possible formation of a new political party is to ensure that the former president’s legacy continues. The movement, calling itself Mazibuye, confirmed that in two weeks it would have made a decision on whether to launch an official party. It says that Zuma was the only president who put the needs of the African native first through implementing free education and radical economic transformation. Mazibuye also says that it does not recognise Cyril Ramaphosa, describing him as a "pseudo revolutionary" whose policies are anti-black. Mazibuyele Emasisweni’s Frank Fakude says through the support of some ANC members, a special general council could remove Ramaphosa. "If people have faith like we have faith in him and elect him again as president, he will become the president of the country." But political analyst Lukhona Mnguni highly doubts this. "It is very difficult to see whyt he ANC would allow it to accede to demands by a pressure group that is external to the organisation Among the demands by the group is that when land has been expropriated, it must be placed in the custodianship of indigenous leaders. This signals that the support from traditional leaders in KwaZulu-Natal is possibly linked to the ongoing heated debate over the dissolution of the Ingonyama Trust.
