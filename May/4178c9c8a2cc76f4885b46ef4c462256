JOHANNESBURG – There’s been another cash-in-transit heist, this time outside Polokwane. It is understood that the criminals used explosives to blow up the vehicle and made off with an undisclosed amount of money early on Monday morning. One of the security guards, who was in the truck at the time of the crime, was injured and has been hospitalised. The police's Moatshe Ngoepe says that no arrests have yet been made. “And during that process their car was blown up partly and an undisclosed amount of cash taken. One security officer was injured. No arrests as yet, hence we’re calling on the members of the community to assist us with regard to information supply.” In the last month, there's been at least ten cash-in-transit heists across the country.
