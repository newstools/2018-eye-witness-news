Unions have been in dead-locked wage negotiations with university management over the past few days. CAPE TOWN - The Walter Sisulu University is looking to the Labour Court to declare a strike by workers and teaching staff, illegal. They want vice-chancellor Rob Midgley to resign. Unions have been in dead-locked wage negotiations with university management over the past few days. It's unclear whether exams will continue next week as scheduled because some lecturers have joined the strike. Nehawu's Mcebisi Jojo says this is about more than just an increase in wages, as they want Midgley to resign due to maladministration. “He’s taking the university backwards, since his arrival we’ve seen high levels of resignations of executive managers, especially females. We believe that there is money. Currently, he’s employing security guards even though there are guards on campus as we hold peaceful protests.” University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo says the strike certificate was only issued for the wage dispute, so the university has approached the Labour Court to declare the strike illegal and unprotected.
