On Friday, two taxi drivers were shot dead in Delft, while on Wednesday a 21-year-old man was shot and killed at the Hanover Park taxi rank. CAPE TOWN – The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has condemned any form of violence in the taxi industry after a spate of attacks in Cape Town. About nine people were attacked at various taxi ranks over the past few weeks. On Friday, two taxi drivers were shot dead in Delft, while on Wednesday a 21-year-old man was shot and killed at the Hanover Park taxi rank. Santaco deputy chairperson Nazeem Abdurahman says: “People can’t come and use the taxi rank. There are innocent people that use the taxi rank to go to work. The police need to work super-fast to get these guys behind bars.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
