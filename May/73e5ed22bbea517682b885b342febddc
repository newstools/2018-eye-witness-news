KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi says the team will provide psycho-social support to the girl's family and her schoolmates. JOHANNESBURG – A team of social workers has been sent to Chatsworth where a nine-year-old girl was killed during a shoot-out between her father and hijackers. Sadia Sukhraj was shot in the stomach on Monday before three attackers fled the scene with her still in the car. KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi says the team will provide psycho-social support to the girl's family and her schoolmates. The MEC's spokesperson Ncumisa Ndelu says: “The MEC is dispatching this team to provide psych-social support to the family. You can imagine the past 24 hours have probably been the worst in their lives. “On Monday, within minutes, they were hijacked and minutes later their little girl was shot dead.” At the same time, Parliament's portfolio committee on Basic Education has expressed outrage following Sukhraj's death. It’s also called for justice to be served, in the case involving a 19-year-old man, who killed two pupils at a North West school at the weekend. Zanda Bylsma is accused of strangling his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend Sharnelle Hough and hanging her 16-year-old best friend Marna Engelbrecht. The two girls were found by the matron at a high school in Stella. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
