Premier Supra Mahumapelo briefs the media on the latest developments in the North West province. JOHANNESBURG - Supra Mahumapelo has announced that he will be going "on early retirement" as premier of the North West. In a briefing at Luthuli House on Wednesday, Mahumapelo says that he made a conscious decision to resign as premier. "So one has arrived at the conscious decision, a very conscious decision, to say we'll have to make sure that one is allowed to go on early retirement on this particular matter. So that those two processes can go on unhindered and without perceptions of one using the office to either defend himself or get at other people who seem to be differing with one politically." But his announcement has not come without a fight. He has accused those who agitated for his removal of being counter-revolutionaries. Meanwhile, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says that the party welcomes Mahumapelo's voluntary resignation as premier. WATCH: ANC briefs media on North West developments
