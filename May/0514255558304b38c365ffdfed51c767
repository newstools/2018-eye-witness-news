The country has experienced an increase in the number of cash van robberies this year, while there have been very few arrests of suspects linked to the attacks. PRETORIA – Unions representing cash-in-transit drivers and personnel want employers to design military-grade vans which are able to withstand heavy weapons fire and explosives. Fedusa will be meeting with employers on Wednesday to raise issues such as staff training, vehicle designs and salaries. The country has experienced an increase in the number of cash van robberies this year, while there have been very few arrests of suspects linked to the attacks. Fedusa says cash trucks must be upgraded, using impregnable military-grade materials in order to ensure the safety of staff who face attacks from well-armed robbers who use explosives to get to the loot. The federation’s Dennis George says: “These vehicles are not properly armoured as it is easy for the criminals to run them off the roads.  The current motor vehicle design is seen as a soft target.” George says they will also ask employers to arm security staff with high-powered rifles, and deploy more resources at the locations where money is picked up and dropped off.
