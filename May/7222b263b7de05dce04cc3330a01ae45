The Public Servants Association of SA has declared a formal dispute after accusing the government of negotiating in bad faith. JOHANNESBURG - The Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) has given the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC) until the end of Wednesday to disclose which other unions have not signed government’s wage offer. The PSA has declared a formal dispute after accusing the government of negotiating in bad faith, while Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) affiliates have agreed to the deal. The salary adjustments over the three-year agreement range between 6% and 7%, depending on the employee’s level, and include a restructured housing allowance. The PSA says it will continue to negotiate with other unions that have not signed the deal, but it’s called on the bargaining council to reveal which unions have rejected the offer. A nod from the Federation of Unions of South Africa’s affiliates will likely tip the scales over the 51% threshold for the deal to be adopted, but they’re still seeking a mandate from members. The bargaining council’s Frikkie de Bruin said: “This agreement doesn’t enjoy the majority, the Constitution requires us to go back to the council and negotiation. There’s no notion of unilateral implementation by the employer.” The parties have until 19 June to decide. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
