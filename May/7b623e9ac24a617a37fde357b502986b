There are more than 1,000 pending farm eviction cases in areas under the Drakenstein Municipality in the Cape, of which 434 are currently in court. CAPE TOWN - NGO Women on Farms says that farm evictions are spurring the growth of informal settlements. There are more than 1,000 pending farm eviction cases in areas under the Drakenstein Municipality in the Cape, of which 434 are currently in court. Thousands of farm workers are affected. The municipality says that in cases where it provides emergency accommodation, it's usually a 24-square metre temporary structure with access to basic services. But Women on Farms' Carmen Louw says that these kinds of measures, while necessary, could prove to be counter-productive. "What they are doing to prepare for those evictions is they are preparing sites for informal settlements within the Drakenstein Municipality, so they are creating informal settlements because of evictions."
