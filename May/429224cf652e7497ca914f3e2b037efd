JOHANNESBURG - Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus says that he hasn’t decided on who will play against Eddie Jones’ England in the first Test match at Emirates Airline Park on 9 June. The new Bok mentor announced his first squad on Saturday that consists of 43 players, 26 of which will travel to the American capital city of Washington DC to take on Wales in their international season opener. Erasmus also announced two captains - utility forward Pieter-Steph du Toit, who will be in charge of the side that will travel to Washington, while flanker Siyamthanda Kolisi will be South Africa’s first ever black captain for the three-Test series against England. However, the former Munster Director of Rugby says that the door is not completely closed on the 26 players that will travel to America, and they could be in contention for a spot in Erasmus’ match day squad for the first Test against England. “There are definitely still lots of spots still available for that first England Test. I want to see how the guys perform against Wales and essentially we want two teams training together for the first 2 or 3 weeks before we cut the squad down ahead of the second Test in Bloemfontein.” There are no less than 17 uncapped players selected in the 43-man squad, in which most will receive their first Test caps against Wales on Saturday.
