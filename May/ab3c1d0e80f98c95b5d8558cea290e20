Of these, 194 achieved a bachelor's pass. An additional 105 candidates passed their matric after applying for re-marks. Provincial Education MEC spokesperson Jessica Shelver says: “The Western Cape achieved the highest percentage of candidates in the country with an access to bachelor degree studies in 2017.
