Two months ago, five-year-old Grade R pupil Lumka Mketwa  drowned in a pit toilet. The Eastern Cape Education Department's Mali Mtima says there are plans in place to build toilets for Grade R pupils. “As the department, we are going to build eight toilets there for the grade Rs, not four but eight. The construction company is supposed to be on site before the end of June,” he said. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
