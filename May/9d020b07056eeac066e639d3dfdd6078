CAPE TOWN – Three men have been sentenced to a total of 40 years in prison for a farm attack in Umhlali. It's understood the convicts broke into the farm owner's home last month where they tied him up along with his wife. The owner's wife died on the scene after the perpetrators physically attacked the couple. A labourer allegedly heard their screams for help and asked an ex-policeman nearby for assistance. The police's Thembeka Mbhele says an investigation led them to the Eastern Cape where the trio were arrested. “The three men were sentenced 25 years for murder, 10 years each on two counts of robbery, five years for attempted murder and three years for possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition.”
