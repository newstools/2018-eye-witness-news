CAPE TOWN - Parliament’s ethics watchdog has decided to institute disciplinary proceedings against ANCMPs Mduduzi Manana and Bongani Bongo, informed sources have told EWN. The Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests met behind closed doors earlier today. The committee has come under fire recently for dragging its feet in acting on complaints against members of Parliament. EWN understands that the committee decided to set up two separate panels that will carry out the disciplinary hearings into MPs Mduduzi Manana and Bongani Bongo. Members of the committee are bound by confidentiality agreements and neither of the co-chairpersons, ANC MPs Amos Masondo or Omie Singh, could be reached for comment. Manana was convicted and fined for the assault of three women last year. Earlier this month he was accused by his domestic worker of throwing her down the stairs of his home, prompting calls for the ANC to sack him as an MP. Bongani Bongo, the former State Security Minister, was accused of attempting to bribe the evidence leader in Parliament’s Eskom inquiry. (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
