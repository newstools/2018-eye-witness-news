Treasury's last quarterly report on the performance of municipalities reveals the expenditure of conditional grants is still lagging behind desired targets. CAPE TOWN - Municipalities are still underspending on capital projects, despite Treasury shifting funds from those that have not been able to spend them. In January the Finance Minister approved the movement of municipal grants from local councils with low spending. But Treasury's last quarterly report on the performance of municipalities reveals the expenditure of conditional grants is still lagging behind desired targets. Between January and March, Treasury reallocated funds from its conditional and infrastructure grants to municipalities that have fast-tracked the implementation of their projects. But the local government third quarter performance report has revealed the municipalities which received the funds are still not spending fast enough. By the end of March, and with only three months left to the end of the financial year, municipalities overall expenditure of grants was only 56% of the almost R32 billion received. Municipalities had during the period under review only spent around 10% of the R340 million received in disaster funding. This was attributed to the late transfer of funds following the national disaster declaration. Treasury has also revealed that collectively municipalities spent less than 55% of their infrastructure grants, a figure it says is very low and concerning. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
