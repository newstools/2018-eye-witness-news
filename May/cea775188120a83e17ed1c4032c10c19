This in response to an increase in break-ins at its District Six campus, in Cape Town. The improvements will cost about R4 million. From the Engineering Faculty to the Student Centre, past the Piazza and all the way down to Keizersgracht Street there are no security guards on CPUT’s District Six campus. These students say safety is a big concern for them, especially when walking to their residences or cars in the parking lots off campus. “There are no security guards visible around the area, making us easy targets when walking back from campus to residences.” CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley says security is challenging at the campus in the city bowl because it's open access, but management is addressing this due to the increase in break-ins. “The barbwire fence which scales the parameter of the site is a temporary measure and will soon be replaced by clear-view fence, which will assist in access control to campus.” It's understood a burglar was caught on Monday night and police have confirmed a suspect was arrested for being in possession of two stolen computers.
