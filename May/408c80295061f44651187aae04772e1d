Protests erupted on Monday morning as members of the community blocked a group from occupying land illegally. JOHANNESBURG - Police opened fire with rubber bullets and used teargas to disperse protesters in Protea Glen on Monday afternoon. Protests erupted on Monday morning as members of the community blocked a group from occupying land illegally. They claim to have the permission of the landowners to build on a plot in the Soweto suburb, but residents from nearby houses won't allow it. The police's Kay Makhubele says protesters have been blocking several roads in the area. “They’ve been talking to police, saying they’re waiting for officials to come and address them. They brought more tyres to the street. That’s why police had to disperse them to open the roads to people.”    (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
