Lavender Hill residents say they can't expect police to deal decisively with gangsterism if people continue to hide criminals in their homes. CAPE TOWN - Lavender Hill residents say they can't expect police to deal decisively with gangsterism if people continue to hide criminals in their homes. They have urged residents with information to come forward. Community Safety MEC Dan Plato, together with the national and provincial police commissioners, General Khehla Sithole and Lieutenant-general Khombinkosi Jula, met community members on Friday to discuss concerns about gangsterism. Many residents complained about a shortage of police patrol vehicles and some raised concerns about officers accepting bribes from gangsters. Community policing forums, neighbourhood watch groups, councillors and residents of Lavender Hill and surrounding areas all had a say on the ongoing problem of gangsterism. One resident says that it is time to expose the gangsters. "Let us stop hiding criminals in our homes. We are the ones who know what is happening but we keep complaining that police are not doing their jobs. Why are we hiding the information?" There is also concern that government is prioritising bailing out state out entities and not allocating more resources to combating crime. "National Treasury has bailed SAA out so many times." Provincial Police Commissioner Jula says that the engagement was not another talk shop but the suggestions by community members will be factored in.
