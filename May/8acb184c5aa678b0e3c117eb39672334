During debate on the Public Audit Amendment Bill in the National Assembly on Tuesday, MP Alan Mcloughlin insisted there’s no impending split in the party. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has once again moved to quash reports that the party is in turmoil and that a split is looming. During debate on the Public Audit Amendment Bill in the National Assembly on Tuesday, MP Alan Mcloughlin insisted there’s no impending split in the party. This comes after weekend newspapers said that senior members of the DA were plotting a breakaway. The Public Audit Amendment Bill will give the Auditor General the power to take remedial action against institutions which waste and misuse public funds. Supporting the Bill, the DA says it’s acted against some of its own senior party members because it believes they must be held accountable for their actions. While he did not specifically name her, McLoughlin made an apparent reference to disciplinary action against Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille. “We can’t claim to be a party of honesty and integrity if we do not show ourselves to be so, even if it flies in the face of public opinion.” He adds the party is not facing a split. “To those of our critics who predicted a rift in the party or dissent in the ranks, all is well in the Democratic Alliance. All you are seeing is us preparing for an election.” The bill has now been referred to the National Council of Provinces for approval. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
