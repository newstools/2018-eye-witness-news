Over a period of three months in 2017, Sibongile Mani spent about R800,000 of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme money she erroneously received. JOHANNESBURG - A Walter Sisulu University student who spent a portion of R14 million that was mistakenly deposited into her account has appeared in court on theft charges. Over a period of three months in 2017, Sibongile Mani spent about R800,000 of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) money she erroneously received. The accounting student allegedly failed to report the error before Nsfas cottoned on. The Hawks’ Anelisa Feni says on Tuesday was Mani’s first court appearance. “This occurred after she was arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crimes unit. The investigating team requested that she hand herself over at the Hawks’ provincial offices in East London.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
