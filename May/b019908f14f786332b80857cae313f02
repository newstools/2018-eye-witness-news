Kim Yong Chol has been closely involved with talks with South Korea as well and his visit to the US would further indicate preparations for the historic summit are moving ahead. SEOUL - Former North Korea spy chief and senior official Kim Yong Chol is headed to the United States after stopping over in Beijing, presumably for talks with US officials regarding a possible summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said on Tuesday. Kim Yong Chol has been closely involved with talks with South Korea as well and his visit to the United States would further indicate preparations for the historic summit are moving ahead. At the same time, a team of US government officials, including the White House deputy chief of staff for operations Joe Hagin, left US Yokota Air Base in Japan for Singapore on Monday, NHK said. The White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to Singapore to meet with North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the historic summit, initially scheduled for 12 June, is moving ahead after Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details. In a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend, Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a surprise meeting on Saturday at the border village of Panmunjom, during which they agreed the North Korea-US summit must be held. Moon said Monday there could be more impromptu talks between the two Koreas in the lead-up to the summit.
