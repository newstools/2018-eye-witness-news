Saccawu is fighting against the dismissal of several employees who were initially on full-time contracts when Woolworths decided it would only employ workers on a flexible basis. JOHANNESBURG - Judgment has been reserved in the Constitutional Court case involving the South African Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union (Saccawu) over the retrenchment of Woolworths employees. The trade union is fighting against the dismissal of several employees who were initially on full-time contracts when Woolworths decided it would only employ workers on a flexible basis. The dispute has been ongoing for several years now, before finally being heard by the Apex Court. Trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), is supporting workers in the case. Cosatu’s Sizwe Pamla said: “This is a case of workers who were procedurally and unfairly dismissed because their employer was trying to reduce their working hours to implement casualisation.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
