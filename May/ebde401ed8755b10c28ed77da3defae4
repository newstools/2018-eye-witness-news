The Cape Town mayor now has only a ceremonial role. CAPE TOWN - The Cape Town Council has voted to strip Mayor Patricia de Lille of her executive powers. De Lille now has only a ceremonial role. The motion was brought by deputy mayor and Democratic Alliance caucus leader Ian Neilson. Hundred-and-thirty-seven voted in favour and 50 against.  De Lille says it’s the citizens of Cape Town who will now suffer as a result of her being stripped of her executive powers. De Lille says she will challenge the decision in court. “I’ve not been consulted nor given reasons as to why my powers have been removed. I just know that it’s going to have devastating effects on service delivery.” Neilson says the DA is entitled to manage the executive of the Cape Town Council. The African National Congress (ANC) leader in council says the DA has no respect for the rule of law. “This item seeks to coerce us, as the council, to attend to this agenda of these conspiracies. The objective of Item 37 is to achieve the same outcome that caused this council to be hauled before the court.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
