MEC Debbie Schafer demanded the organisation cease operations in schools in the province, until she's met with them and discussed a way forward. CAPE TOWN – Equal Education  and the Western Cape Education MEC have come to an agreement for the organisation to continue its work in the province. Earlier in the week, MEC Debbie Schafer demanded the organisation cease operations in schools in the province, until she's met with them and discussed a way forward. Schafer expressed concern following accusations of sexual misconduct against three former senior Equal Education managers, including its co-founder. LISTEN: Is Zackie Achmat covering up allegations of sexual harassment at Equal Education?  But Schafer's spokesperson Jessica Shelver says both parties have since met and have agreed to work on a new policy for Non-governmental Organisations and Non-Profit Organisations working in schools. “Given that the three accused have also resigned their positions at Equal Education, and that there are no planned activities at our schools in the next few weeks because of the exams and the holidays coming up, we have agreed that we will await the outcome of the investigations which Equal Education is hoping will be finalised in the next few weeks before deciding whether we need to take further action.” Equal Education's Noncedo Madubedube says two independent panels are looking into sexual harassment allegations against former General Secretary Tshepo Motshepe and former treasurer Doron Isaacs. “We came out of the meeting with an agreement that Equal Education will first commit to meeting with the WCED and the MEC after we have concluded our internal investigation, but also to be cognisant of our presence inside schools between now and when that investigation is finalised.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
