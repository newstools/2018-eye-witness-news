Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin says Africa and Europe must stand together to counter the threats and challenges posed by the United States in a unipolar world. PRETORIA - Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin says that Africa and Europe must stand together to counter the threats and challenges posed by the United States in a unipolar world. He was speaking at the South African Institute for International Affairs in Johannesburg. He says the world’s stability is at stake with US President Donald Trump’s decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to renounce the nuclear treaty with Iran. “The world has not sufficient backbone to be able to stand such challenges in all; so we need to reinforce the backbone of the world.” De Villepin says the Africa-Europe partnership will be driven by crisis management the Sahel, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Horn of Africa.
