CAPE TOWN - Calm has been restored to Woodlands in Mitchell's Plain following days of violent protests over land and housing. Several shops were looted, and roads barricaded after authorities removed 20 illegally erected structures in the area on Monday night. About 150 people took to the streets in protest against the evictions.
