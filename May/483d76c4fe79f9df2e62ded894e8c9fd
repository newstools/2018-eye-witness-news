JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in Mpumalanga has confirmed that an MKMVA member, who was commissioned to provide security at the Gert Sibande regional conference, was shot dead at the Badplaas Municipal offices where registration took place. Several others were assaulted and taken to hospital after the violence at the weekend. But that did not stop the conference going ahead. The provincial youth league's Pholoso Mbatsane says he does not understand why the conference went on despite there being a crime scene just outside. Mbatsane has called on police find the perpetrators. “We’re told that apparently, there was a crowd or a group of people who were rented to come and disrupt congress. We’re not told by whom or for what reasons but we’re really in pain to what happened in Gert Sibande.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
