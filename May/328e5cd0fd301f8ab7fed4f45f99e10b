CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) says the alarmingly high rate of gender-based violence in South Africa is concerning and needs to be addressed. In a statement, it calls on the ANC government treat this as a “national crisis” and “national security threat”. This follows the arrest of a 19-year-old man for the murder of two North West school girls who were found dead at their hostel over the weekend. At the same time, the suspended commissioner of the Revenue Service, Tom Moyane, faces allegations of physically assaulting the 17-year-old mother of his grandson. EWN on Monday morning contacted Moyane and his lawyer for comment but they were not available for comment. The ANCWL says it's imperative all sectors of society work together to combat gender-based violence and strengthen equality. It has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s commitment to fighting gender-based violence. “The ANCWL calls all members of society to join the president in the forefront.” The ANCWL has also highlighted the role of the media in the fight against gender-based crime. “Radio stations, Television stations and newspapers have a platform that they can use effectively to discourage patriarchy and male chauvinism. Programs or stories that reinforces the patriarchal practices and objectification of women must be banned from media platforms.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
