Management at the institution has decided to bolster security, especially at its District Six campus in Cape Town, following an increase in break-ins. CAPE TOWN - The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) will be spending millions on security improvements that will take effect in the coming weeks. Management at the institution has decided to bolster security, especially at its District Six campus in Cape Town, following an increase in break-ins. In the latest incident, a suspect was arrested after being caught with two computers stolen from a building on campus on Monday night. Eyewitness News wasn't stopped once while roaming the District Six campus and entering some of the buildings and no security guards were spotted either. Some CPUT students say that safety is not a guarantee on campus, as anyone can enter without needing to produce a student card. CPUT says the barbed wire that's currently around the perimeter of the campus will be replaced by a Clear Vu fence in the next few weeks, which will hopefully help with access control. Spokesperson for CPUT, Lauren Kansley, says that security at the District Six campus is especially challenging as it's open access. "The appointment of consultants to design and install CCTV and access control systems at all of our campuses will also be a welcome measure to controlling theft and managaing safety concerns." The security upgrades at all the campuses will cost the institution about R4 million.
