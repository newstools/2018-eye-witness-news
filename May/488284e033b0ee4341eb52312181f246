This is one of the key messages being given to communities as the country marks Child Protection Week. CAPE TOWN - A child abuse NGO has stressed the fact that there is no waiting period to report a child missing. This is one of the key messages being given to communities as the country marks Child Protection Week. The issue of reporting missing children has again been highlighted in the Courtney Pieters’ murder trial this week. Juanita Pieters has this week testified how she rushed to the Elsies River Police Station after she was told her daughter had disappeared.   She says a woman at the station advised her to go home and continue her search for her daughter, and if her search was unsuccessful she should return to the police station to file a missing person’s report. Matla A Bana’s Monique Strydom says not enough people are aware that waiting 24 hours to report a missing child is a myth. “That first hour of when a person goes missing is the most crucial time, as that’s the hour where you have the most success in recovering the person.” Strydom says it’s important that police officers receive regular training on how to efficiently deal with cases of missing children.
