Parliament is currently winding down its business with 19 committee meetings this week, before MPs depart to their various provinces for constituency work from June until August. JOHANNESBURG – It’s a bumper week ahead for Parliament which is expected to push through several pieces of legislation before Members of Parliament (MPs) go on a two-month recess. Parliament is currently winding down its business with 19 committee meetings this week, before MPs depart to their various provinces for constituency work from June until August. The National Assembly and NCOP plenaries scheduled for this week will deal with key debates, which include budget votes, and the finalisation of at least six Bills before both houses. It’s a race against time and all hands on deck for MPs this week. After a hectic month of processing bills and passing department budgets, MPs will go on a two-and-a-half-month recess. The pending recess doesn’t mean Parliament’s work will come to a halt, says spokesperson Moloto Mothapo. “The National Assembly from 30 May to 15 June, there will be committee work. That means that the committee of the National Assembly will be meeting throughout this period.” During the prolonged recess, there will be no opportunity for oral or written questions, including those directed at President Cyril Ramaphosa, his deputy or any Cabinet minister.
