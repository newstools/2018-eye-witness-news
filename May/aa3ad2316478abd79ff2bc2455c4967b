CAPE TOWN - Following violent protests in Mitchells Plain, Woodlands residents and the ward councillor have met on Tuesday afternoon. On Monday, residents took to the streets demanding land and housing. Protesters vandalised and looted a fuel station and several shops. The violence erupted after authorities removed 20 illegally erected structures. Councillor Joan Woodman said: “We know it all stems from the situation in Isiqalo informal settlement, where false information about residents getting houses is being spread. There are criteria that must be met. We’ve called a meeting with leadership so they can listen to their grievances.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
