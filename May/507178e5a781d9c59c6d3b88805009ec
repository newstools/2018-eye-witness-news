The average is currently 19%, compared to 16.6% last week. CAPE TOWN - There's been a slight increase in dam levels in the Western Cape. The average is currently 19%, compared to 16.6% last week. The Voelvlei Dam is at 16.6%, the Theewaterskloof Dam is at 14.7% and the Bergriver Dam is at 42%. Environmental Affairs MEC spokesperson James-Brent Styan says although levels have increased, the drought is still far from over. “We want to caution people that this drought is far from over. We’ve also stated that we need an above average rainfall season and it needs to rain in our catchment areas for our dams to recover adequately. We’re not close to feeling comfortable yet and urge the public to use water sparingly even when there is rain.” Styan says the prospects for more rain remain optimistic with the SA Weather Services predicting good rainfall by Monday afternoon.
