Police have confirmed that an assault case has been opened against Moyane after reports emerged that he kicked and tackled his grandson's teenage mother. JOHANNESBURG – Suspended South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane may have to add yet another charge to his name. The embattled revenue service head has been warned by authorities to present himself to the Roodeport Magistrates Court this Friday to find out whether he'll be facing prosecution for assault. Police have confirmed that an assault case has been opened against Moyane after reports emerged that he kicked and tackled his grandson's teenage mother. It’s understood the incident took place in Johannesburg last week, and investigations into the alleged assault of the 17-year-old mother are underway. Police spokesman Lungelo Dlamini says it is now up to the prosecutor to decide if Moyane has a case to answer to.“The police are investigating a case of assault which will be placed on the roll on Friday, this coming Friday. For the court to decide whether to charge the accused or not. But he has been warned to be in court on that day.” Moyane is also facing 12 charges of misconduct and is being investigated by the Hawks. The former Sars head and President Cyril Ramaphosa  have been engaged in a back and forth through legal letters since he was suspended and a commission of inquiry into his fitness to hold office was instituted.
