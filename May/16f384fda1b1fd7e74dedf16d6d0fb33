Over the first four months or so of this year there have been 145 protests across Cape Town. CAPE TOWN - Overwhelmed by protests the City of Cape Town  has appealed to the South African Police Service (SAPS) to set up a committee to help deal with demonstrations. Over the first four months or so of this year there have been 145 protests across Cape Town. Last year, during the same period, 84 protests were recorded. The city's JP Smith  says that this marks a 73% increase in demonstrations that have grown increasingly more violent. “Mostly residents who invade land are the ones who ultimately have to deal with extreme flood, fire, health and safety risks when settling illegally on land that’s not being earmarked for you for human settlement and might not be suitable for it. Between SAPS and the city, we have deployed hundreds of resources to quell these violent protests at the expense of other communities who are robbed of the policing presence,” he said.
