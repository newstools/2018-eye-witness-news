Auditors looking at the books of the eThekwini Municipality have now been recalled. JOHANNESBURG - Security has been beefed up after officials at the Auditor-General's KwaZulu-Natal office received death threats while looking at the books of the eThekwini Municipality. Auditors have now been recalled. The eThekwini Municipality's Mthunzi Gumede: "The eThekwini Municipality will be providing security to ensure that the staff of the Auditor-General are working withour fear or favour. In the meantime, the SAPS must investigate the matter so that we can get to the bottom of it." Earlier this week, Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu released the latest audit outcomes for the country's municipalities and it is not a pretty picture. Many municipalities are in their worst state in five years.
