CAPE TOWN - The Hawks has welcomed the conviction of a former police officer who plotted the murder of an Elliotdale station commander. Former warrant officer Phumzile Ngqayimbana and hitman Siyamcela Ntshitshi have been convicted for the murder of Colonel Nomalizo Dukumbana in 2013. Hawks spokesperson Anelisa Feni said: “It’s claimed the former warrant officer who was Dukumbana’s subordinate connived with the other man who’s been found guilty to kill the station commander for instituting a disciplinary hearing against him.” Constable Noxolo Matya, who sought the services of the hitman, confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment three years ago.
