The Mamelodi senior choir rendered an emotional tribute to the late Tabane at a memorial service at the Mamelodi community hall. JOHANNESBURG – Members of the Mamelodi community and fellow musicians gathered at the Mamelodi west community hall to pay tribute to veteran musician Philip Tabane on Thursday. Tabane died last week at the age of 84. The Mamelodi senior choir rendered an emotional tribute to the late Tabane at a memorial service at the Mamelodi community hall.  Fellow musician Dr Sello Galane and veteran actress Advocate Nakedi Ribane were the programme directors with a performance by legendary guitarist Vusi Mahlesela scheduled to take place. Tabane is being remembered for his love for the Sepedi heritage and the Mamelodi community. Letta Mbulu and Don Laka were amongst the audience. Galane says Tabane had a great influence on how he learned to appreciate and create music. He says Tabane taught him that there is more to music than just instruments and notes and that Tabane’s approach to music was largely influenced by his heritage and what was happening around him at the time. Galane says Tabane would ask him why he chose music. “Do we use musical notes to make music or do we use memory and notes as just tools to represent the emotion?” Tabane will be laid to rest in Mamelodi this weekend.
