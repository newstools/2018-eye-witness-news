CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Social Development Department  has rolled-out its Eye On The Child programme to mark the start of Child Protection Week. The announcement was made during an oversight visit to the newly opened Oudtshoorn Social Development office on Monday. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz says the programme is the brainchild of its NGO partner Child Welfare South Africa. MEC spokesperson Sihle Ngobese says the organisation and the Afrikaanse Christelike Vroue Vereeniging have already been running the programme across the province with great results in bolstering the prevention of child abuse and neglect. “Social Development will roll out the programme by building a network of volunteers who are recruited, vetted and trained and paid a stipend to act as an early warning system to spot children at risk. The primary role of these volunteers will be to call the social worker and refer all matters if they’ve identified a risk.” Ngobese says data from the Western Cape child death review panels will be used to identify and map the highest risk neighbourhoods. “The Western Cape child death review panels are made up of experts of the Department of Social Development, the Department of Health, academics from the Cape universities and our partners from the National Prosecuting Authority.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
