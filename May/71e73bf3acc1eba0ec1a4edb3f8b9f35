The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union says the strike involves all unions and several other hospitals in Gauteng. JOHANNESBURG - The Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg remains closed as protests continue inside, where workers are demanding higher wages and bonuses. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) says the strike involves all unions and several other hospitals in Gauteng.  Singing and dancing continue at the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital where many protesters are holding posters which read: “higher wages, or no vote in 2019”. Representatives of Nehawu addressed the crowd earlier on Thursday afternoon explaining the extent of this strike. “We, as Nehawu, Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa, Public Servants Association of South Africa, Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa, as well as workers of the department, have united in a common, valid, just and legitimate demand. We must remain united.”  The pharmacy also remains closed as protesters are moving through the hospital, while some doctors and nurses help patients navigate through the rubbish in the corridors.
