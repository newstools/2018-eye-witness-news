Housing allowances have emerged as the latest sticking point in ongoing talks, with the threat of a nationwide civil servant strike looming. Saftu's also turned down a 7% pay hike offer. The Public Servants Association has however indicated that it is willing to accept an increase of between 6% and 7%. Saftu's Moleko Phakedi says that other benefits such as the housing allowance are not being taken into account. "Public servants have been demanding an increased housing allowance to be inclusive. The unfortunate thing is that the agreement would not necessarily make that a reality for workers who are not enjoying the housing benefit."
