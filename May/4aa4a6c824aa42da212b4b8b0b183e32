The party's secretary general Ace Magashule says the NEC condemns what he calls 'targeted killings' in reference to the rise in political murders. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC)'s national executive committee (NEC) has expressed concern over the growing rate of violent crimes across the country. The party's Secretary General Ace Magashule says the NEC condemns what he calls “targeted killings” in reference to the rise in political murders. “The ANC remains deeply alarmed by the spate of criminal targeted killings throughout the country.” Over the past weekend alone, there were three politically motivated killings, adding to the growing number. In KwaZulu-Natal, an ANC member was shot dead in his home in front of his family in uMzimkhulu’s Harry Gwala region. A National Freedom Party chairperson was also killed in the Natal Midlands when he was attacked while driving his vehicle. In Mpumalanga, a member of the MKMVA was gunned down at an ANC Youth League conference in the Gert Sibande region on Saturday. While Magashule condemned these crimes, he refused to acknowledge their political nature. “Killings are killings, they’re criminal. It’s a criminal thing, you can’t turn it political.” The ANC has called on law enforcement to take swift action, but Magashule would not say whether they believed threatened councillors in KwaZulu-Natal need extra security.
