Kweyama says talks with various stakeholders on how to get the railway agency back on track have already begun. JOHANNESBURG – The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa)'s interim board chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama says the newly appointed committee plans to bring stability and accountability to the railway company. Kweyama led the board on a tour to various Metrorail stations in Johannesburg on Monday. The state-owned enterprise has been faced with a number of problems including corruption, aging infrastructure and vandalism. Kweyama says talks with various stakeholders on how to get the railway agency back on track have already begun. “A committee meeting that we had last week, we’ve met and we’ve agreed that we’re going to recommend to the board that vacant positions should be filled.” When asked about how the board plans to tackle corruption, Kweyama had this to say. “Those who are [corrupt] need to be, as far as proper investigation has happened, they must be called out but due process is also important.” On Monday, the board visited different Metrorail stations to assess the issues faced by the operator and commuters on a daily basis and say they will now return to the drawing board and come up with interventions.
