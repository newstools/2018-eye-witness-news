CAPE TOWN - Law enforcement officials are keeping a close eye on a group planning to erect shacks in Woodlands. Residents from the Mitchells Plain area are marking plots on three different pieces of land in the area. The city says the residents have been there since Friday night. Resident Noel Thomas says he's been on a waiting list for a council house for 27 years. "I have the proof... everything. When I phone them, they say 'no, you must wait.' Must I wait another 20 years? Then, I'll be dead. I'm, fighting for my children, not for me." A few weeks ago, a group of Mitchells Plain residents tried to stop residents from the neighbouring Siqalo informal settlement from protesting for basic service delivery. The situation became violent between the two groups, with different authorities stepping in to quell tensions. WATCH: Mapping Cape Town's housing protests
