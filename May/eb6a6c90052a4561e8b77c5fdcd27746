CAPE TOWN - A Gugulethu ward councillor is appealing for calm after the area joined a growing list of Cape Town suburbs hit by violent protests in recent days. Early on Friday morning some roads were blockaded and a number of vehicles torched. The demonstrations stem from anger over a lack of hosuing. Councillor Sharon Manata says that a group people had illegally erected shacks on a piece of vacant land, which were demolished by authorities. "We are appealing to them that there are ways we can sit and talk, and my door is always open, but demolishing and burning [things] is not the way." WATCH: Mapping Cape Town's housing protests
