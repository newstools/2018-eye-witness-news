The former Springbok wing told off fellow commentators Nick Mallett and Naas Botha during a post-match analysis segment. JOHANNESBURG - Former Springbok and SuperSport analyst Ashwin Willemse walked out of a live broadcast following the Lions 42-24 victory over the Brumbies on Saturday evening. In a heated exchange with fellow analysts Nick Mallet and Naas Botha, Willemse said that he was tired of being “patronised” by Mallet and Botha said that he had endured being called a quota player for his entire playing career. “I’ve been in the game for a long time like most of us here. As a player, I’ve been called a quota for a long time and I’ve worked very hard to earn the respect I have now. I’m not going to sit here and be patronized by these two individuals (Mallet and Botha) who played their rugby during the apartheid era, a segregated era.” It is still unclear what prompted the exchange between Willemse and Mallet.
