It’s emerged the SA Council for Educator has not had access to the National Sexual Offenders Register in the Justice Department and only made the request for access last year. JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Basic Education says the South African Council for Educators is mandated by an act of Parliament to ensure the highest standards of the teaching profession are upheld at all times, including the vetting of individuals before they are employed at schools. It’s emerged the council has not had access to the National Sexual Offenders Register in the Justice Department and only made the request for access last year. The Education Department’s Elijah Mhlanga says they have powers to blacklist known offenders. “They are the ones who are given the task of upholding the highest professional standards and striking teachers off the roll when they’re found guilty. They should also conduct investigations to ensure our teachers do the right things in schools.” At the same time, the department says teacher vetting has not been happening as it should. “The department has always urged provinces to ensure teachers who are employed are vetted before employment, but we’ve noted it doesn’t always happen as it should.” Mhlanga added the responsibility of ensuring learner safety also lies with the council.
