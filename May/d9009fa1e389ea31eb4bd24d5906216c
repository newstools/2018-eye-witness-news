The man has been targeting victims in the Zwelihle community since September 2015. CAPE TOWN - Police have arrested an alleged serial rapist in Hermanus. The suspect appeared in court earlier this week after officers linked him to several rape cases. The man has been targeting victims in the Zwelihle community since September 2015. His modus operandi would be to approach women who were walking alone in the Zwelihle informal settlement. He'd then allegedly force them to a deserted area at knifepoint - where they would be robbed and raped. The Police's Frederick Van Wyk says the suspect had been arrested in the past - but had to be released due to a lack of evidence. “Most of the crimes were committed at an old dumping area. In most cases, the suspect had a balaclava or stocking over his face which made identifying him very difficult.”
