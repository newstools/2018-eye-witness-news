CAPE TOWN - One recent study shows South Africans have little awareness of Parliament  or what it does, while another study by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) reflects a significant drop in the public's level of trust in the institution. Eyewitness News has copies of reports relating to research done for Parliament by both Ipsos and the council. In work done late last year, Ipsos tested levels of awareness of Parliament and what it does, while the council carried out a pilot satisfaction survey. The Ipsos survey found that only a quarter of South Africans over 18 were confident in their awareness of Parliament, with 19% saying they knew it well and 5%, extremely well. But 30% said they knew Parliament only by name, with 2% saying they’d never even heard of it. That’s about three in 10 South Africans. The survey involved just over 3,500 respondents and was weighted to reflect the broader population. An HSRC pilot study, meanwhile, shows a sharp drop in levels of trust in Parliament. In its report to Parliament, the HSRC notes an alarming decline in trust for most government institutions, but says “the steepness of the downward trend is most notable for Parliament”. The HSRC found members of Parliament and its employees were far more positive in their evaluation of Parliament and the work that it does than were external stakeholders. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
