In 2008, a xenophobic attack erupted in South Africa claiming over 50 lives and leaving over 15,000 people displaced. JOHANNESBURG - Africa Awake is commemorating the 10th anniversary of the 2008 xenophobic attacks by remembering the victims. In 2008, a xenophobic attack erupted in South Africa claiming over 50 lives and leaving over 15,000 people displaced. Africa Awake will showcase a documentary and an exhibition at 56Pim Studio in Newtown on Thursday. The documentary, Blood and Fire, is based on Ernesto Nhamuave, a Mozambican who was burned alive in the Ramaphosa informal settlement in the East Rand. Speaking to Eyewitness News, Africa Awake’s director Romy Petersen says they have themed the event “Kwere” to dismantle negative connotations around foreign nationals in the country. Kwere is an offensive term used by black people to refer to foreign Africans. Petersen says they want to provoke thought around the issue of the attack on foreign nationals. Meanwhile, the founder of Africa Awake Gabriel Hertis says xenophobic attacks are an international problem. Hertis says the organisations plans to visit the Ramaphosa informal settlement to work with the community. He says by understanding the community’s grievances it is when they can affect real change.
