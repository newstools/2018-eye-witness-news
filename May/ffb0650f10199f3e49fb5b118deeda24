This comes after MEC Debbie Schafer demanded that Equal Education cease operations in schools in the province, following accusations of sexual misconduct by three senior Equal Education managers. CAPE TOWN - Equal Education will meet with the Western Cape Education MEC once its investigations into sexual harassment allegations against three of its members are complete. The organisation has come to an agreement with the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) after meeting with officials. This comes after MEC Debbie Schafer demanded that Equal Education cease operations in schools in the province, following accusations of sexual misconduct by three senior Equal Education managers. The men have since resigned from their positions. Schafer's spokesperson Jessica Shelver: "They have agreed to keep us informed of the findings and we will meet again once the investigations are concluded. We wish to remind our learners that any abuse that suffered under any abuse they suffer at schools from any party can be reported to the Safe Schools hotline on 0800 45 46 47." Equal Education's Noncedo Madubedube says this matter has been a major learning curve for the entire organisation. "To allow us to start thinking positively and deliberately around the politics that we've inherited and taken on as a movement, to looking at how, even if we've got policies in place, how do we reinforce and make sure that everyone that comes into the movement and works with school learners, believes in the mission."
