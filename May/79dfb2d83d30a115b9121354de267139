Untu spokesperson Sonja Carstens says they are especially concerned about rail safety on the central line where there have now been two train fires in the space of a week. CAPE TOWN - The United National Transport Union (Untu) has raised concerns following a fatal fire on a train in Cape Town. One person died after a blaze broke out in a carriage near Ottery station on Wednesday.  During a separate incident about a week ago, two carriages were also allegedly set alight at Retreat railway station. Untu spokesperson Sonja Carstens says they are especially concerned about rail safety on the central line where there have now been two train fires in the space of a week. Over the past few months the line has also been struck by vandalism and attacks. In response, the operator increased security. However, Castens says more needs to be done. “The only solution to Prasa’s problems will be a holistic approach where all stakeholders come on board.” Metrorail is offering a R25,000 reward for information that could assist in the investigation into Wednesday morning's fatal fire. The cause of the fire is still being determined, but authorities suspect arson. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
