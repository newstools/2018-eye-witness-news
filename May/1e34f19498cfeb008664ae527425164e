The city says police data indicates there have been 145 protests in the first four and a half months of the year compared to 84 during the same period last year. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has made a request to South African Police Service to establish a priority committee on protests following an increase in violent demonstrations over past few months. The city says police data indicates there have been 145 protests in the first four and a half months of the year compared to 84 during the same period last year. Mayco member JP Smith says it represents about a 73% increase in protests that have grown progressively more violent. Smith adds that in order to discourage people from settling on land that is not suitable for human habitation, the anti-land invasion unit removes on average 15,000 illegal structures a year. However, over the first four months, it was more than 26,000. Meanwhile, in Woodlands, Mitchells Plain violent protests were still underway on Monday where demonstrators demanded housing. Authorities say about 150 people burnt tyres and fired live rounds at police. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
