Scores of residents descended on the Christian Revival Centre on Tuesday afternoon to pay their respects to the girl who was shot in a foiled hijacking on Monday. DURBAN - Mourners say the death of nine-year-old Sadia Sukhraj during a botched hijacking has united the Chatsworth community against crime. Scores of residents descended on the Christian Revival Centre on Monday afternoon to pay their respects to the girl who was shot in the foiled crime on Monday.  The grade four pupil died in hospital after she was caught up in the gunfight between her father and three hijackers. One suspect died, a 39-year-old has been arrested and their accomplice is on the run. The Chatsworth community is grappling to come to terms with the girl’s tragic death. As hundreds of mourners wept over the child’s open casket, her parents Shailendra and Lorraine were comforted by the community. Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane, who was among the bereaved, says children should be protected at all costs. Maimane has called for the police service to be bolstered. “We grieve today but we are also angry as a community here. How many more children must die before we capacitate police stations like Chatsworth so that we’re more effective at fighting crime?”  The child’s death sparked outrage from the local community which demonstrated outside the local police station on Monday night. At least 20 people arrested for taking part in the violent clashes with officers outside the Chatsworth Police Station will appear in court on Wednesday. Authorities are appealing for calm in the community. Police Minister Bheki Cele will be visiting the Chatsworth following the incident. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
