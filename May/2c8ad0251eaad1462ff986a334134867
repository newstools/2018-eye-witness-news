The accused allegedly profited R90,000 from The Grand in Cape Town by forcing managers there to make use of their security. CAPE TOWN - Controversial businessman Nafiz Modack was closely guarded at a court appearance in connection with an alleged protection racket. The extortion case against Modack, Colin Booysen - who's the brother of alleged gang boss Jerome ‘Donkie’ Booysen - and three others has been postponed to 12 June. They allegedly profited R90,000 from The Grand in Cape Town, by forcing managers there to make use of their security. Modack was escorted from the Cape Town Regional Court by private security guards dressed in black. During a brief court hearing, the State informed the magistrate that it has furnished the defence with an amended charge sheet. The court then instructed the prosecution to provide the defence with the necessary further particulars. Modack and his co-accused were released from custody earlier this year, after spending more than two months in jail awaiting trial. Following a lengthy bail application, Magistrate Joe Magele ruled there was insufficient evidence against them. Numerous claims were made in court during the bail application. The investigating officer gave evidence of an apparent turf war between the security group headed by Modack and another faction led by controversial businessman Mark Lifman. The court also heard allegations that Modack ordered hits on Lifman and alleged gang boss Booysen. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
