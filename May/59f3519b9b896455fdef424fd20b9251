Ruan Dreyer has spent his club career to date as part of the Lions organisation, playing for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup and the Lions in Super Rugby. JOHANNESBURG - Lions prop Ruan Dreyer will leave the Lions Rugby Union and has signed for English club Gloucerster from the start of the 2019/19 English rugby season. Dreyer has spent his club career to date as part of the Lions organisation, playing for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup and the Lions in Super Rugby. For the latter, he was a key part of Johan Ackermann’s squad who reached back to back Super Rugby Finals. A former member of South Africa Under 20 side who competed at the 2010 Junior World Championship, he toured Europe with the Springboks in 2014 and won his first Springbok cap against France last summer. He has now won four caps. Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys says Dreyer will add another dynamic to the forward pack. “We know that successful Premiership teams are built upon a dominant pack and a strong platform up front, and Ruan’s signing, along with the other additions we’ve made to the squad, will help us to achieve that. “He’s a player who Johan knows very well from their time together with the Lions, and with Ruan’s Super Rugby and International experience, we’re very excited to see the impact that Ruan can make at Gloucester Rugby.” The front rower says he is looking forward to life in England and being reunited with some former Lions teammates. “Gloucester is a small city with lots of loyal rugby supporters that stands behind their team. Obviously, it will be nice playing alongside Ruan [Ackermann] and Jaco [Kriel] again, and I’m looking forward to meeting the new teammates and all the new characters in the squad.”
