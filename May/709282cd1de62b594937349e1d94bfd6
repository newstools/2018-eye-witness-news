On Monday, the dam was just over a 107% full. CAPE TOWN - The Water and Sanitation Department says the Misverstand Dam near Moorreesburg has been overflowing. On Monday, the dam was just over a 107% full. The Misverstand Dam provides water to towns like Saldanha Bay, Moorreesburg and Piketberg and was recently boosted with water from the Berg River Dam. The department’s Malusi Rayi said: “Currently, it’s overflowing at 107%, last week it was at 63%. This increase can be attributed to the rains that we’ve received, and last month we transferred some water from the Berg River Dam to Misverstand.”
