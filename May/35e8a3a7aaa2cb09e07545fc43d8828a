CAPE TOWN - Parliament's police portfolio committee has condemned what it calls the senseless killing of Hawks captain, Qeya Jonas Tshabalala, in Bloemfontein. Tshabalala (52) was attacked while attending to a complaint in Phelindaba on Thursday night. It is alleged that two gunmen entered the house that the officers responded to and opened fire. Tshabalala returned fire, wounding one suspect. The assailants fled with the officer's official phone, service pistol and his state vehicle. Officials say the blood-stained vehicle has since been found abandoned in Dewesdorp.
