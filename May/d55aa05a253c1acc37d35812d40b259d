The Hawks' Hangwani Mulaudzi says that members of the public must come forward if they believe they are victims of this scam. JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks say that their investigation into a billion rand investment scheme may just be the tip of the iceberg, with possibly thousands of people affected. It is understood that around 28,000 people so far have been targeted by Bitcaw Trading Company, also known as BTC Global, to invest with promises of 2% interest a day, 14% per week and ultimately 50% per month. Payments were allegedly made every Monday and some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped. The Hawks' Hangwani Mulaudzi says that members of the public must come forward if they believe they are victims of this scam. "Lots of people put in lots of money, including their pensions. We've managed to uncover that lots of people were part of this investment scam."
