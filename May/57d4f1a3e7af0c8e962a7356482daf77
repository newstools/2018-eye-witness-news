LONDON – A set of human teeth discovered in Berlin in 1945 have been found to be those of German wartime leader Adolf Hitler, according to scientists. The dental remains have been held in storage in Moscow since their discovery shortly after the collapse of the Nazi regime at the end of the Second World War. Now scientific analysis appears to end any remaining conspiracy theories that Hitler might have fled to freedom. More than 70 years after being discovered near the German Fuhrer’s wartime bunker, the teeth have been analysed by scientists and declared to be definitely those of Adolf Hitler. French researchers were granted access to the remains, with their studies on the accompanying skull also indicating that Hitler didn’t commit suicide by shooting himself in the mouth, as many historians have believed. The research has also revealed Hitler’s terrible dental health. Only four of the Fuhrer’s teeth were real, with all others seemingly replaced after decaying due to poor diet and addiction to medicines.
