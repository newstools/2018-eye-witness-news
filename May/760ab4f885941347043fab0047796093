The City Press reported that the party could split with several senior members looking to form their own party under the leadership of western cape premier Helen Zille. JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says channels to raise concerns in his party are open and senior members should speak up if they have grievances. The City Press reported that the party could split with several senior members looking to form their own party under the leadership of Western Cape Premier Helen Zille. In response, Maimane has denied this, saying the DA is unified ahead of next year's general elections. Maimane says a report that there is a possible split in his party is baseless and malicious, denying that some MPs are dissatisfied. He says all senior members know how to raise concerns. “We’re focused on the 2019 general elections and in fact we’re the only party that’s bringing black and white South Africans together.” In a tweet from her official account, Zille says such speculation about the DA is bizarre and everyone she knows in the party believes in inclusion.  There have been reports that there are tensions over race and transformation in the party but Maimane says that is untrue.
