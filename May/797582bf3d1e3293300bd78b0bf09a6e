CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille tabled the cityâ€™s budget for the 2018/2019 financial year on Wednesday. The overall budget is R47.7 billion, much of which will be ploughed in to upgrading informal settlements, improving basic services and fine-tuning the city's plans to address the drought. In what could be her last speech as mayor, De Lille delivered the budget announcing that over R4 billion will go towards improving basic services at informal settlements, among other things.  Nearly R2 billion has been allocated for transport and urban development and a further R1.1 billion for energy. The city received more than 50,00 comments from the public. Ratepayers had their say on a host of issues. But most spoke out against proposed water tariff hikes. Their comments have convinced city bosses to reduce the two key water tariffs from 26,9% to 19,9% and 55,1% to 10,1%.  The amended new water plan now stands as R14.1 billion over the next five years instead of the originally proposed amount of R19 billion. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
