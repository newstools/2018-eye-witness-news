The city says proposals in the bill that the city is endorsing relate to additional curbs on smoking in public places, shutdown of indoor smoking areas and regulations for electronic devices. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says it supports National Government's Draft Tobacco Bill which is currently out for public participation. Thursday is World No Tobacco Day. The bill is intended to replace the Tobacco Products Control Act of 1993. The city says since July 2017, it's conducted more than 17,000 inspections at formal food premises with a recorded compliance rate of 99%. The municipality adds that a total of 37 smoking-related complaints were received and 24 fines were issued during the same period. Mayoral committee member JP Smith said: “The fact that the Draft Tobacco Bill proposes fewer opportunities to smoke in public means the city’s agencies will have a far easier time in terms of enforcement. Currently, one of our biggest headaches is non-compliance at social establishments, particularly in nightclubs, and establishments not abiding by the provisions of the legislation.” Smith says proposals in the bill that the city is endorsing relate to additional curbs on smoking in public places, the effective shutdown of indoor smoking areas and regulations for electronic devices. “More importantly, it will reduce the potential harm caused by second-hand smoking. Respiratory disease is a major challenge in Cape Town, in part, because we continue to have such high rates of smoking. One such example is pneumonia with one in five child deaths attributed to the disease.”
