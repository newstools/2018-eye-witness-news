The committee will have to determine whether President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision earlier this month to place the province under administration is justified. CAPE TOWN - The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) has established an ad hoc committee to look into intervention taken in the North West province. The committee will have to determine whether President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision earlier this month to place the province under administration is justified. It has 180 days to report back to the NCOP on its determination. Headed by the African National Congress’ Charel de Beer, who also chaired the committee on the intervention in Limpopo in 2011, the North West ad hoc committee comprises of 11 members from the ANC, Democratic Alliance, Economic Freedom Fighters and Inkatha Freedom Party. Members of Parliament agreed that their first order of business should be to meet with the inter-ministerial committee headed by Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. De Beer says its first step will be to meet with the task team. “Let us do our work, that we consult with the honourable Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma leading that team and get a way forward.” The ad hoc committee will have to review the North West intervention regularly and make recommendations to the national executive. It will have to report back to the NCOP within 10 days of compiling its report on whether the intervention should be approved. If the intervention is deemed necessary, the committee will have to regularly investigate whether it should be allowed to continue.
