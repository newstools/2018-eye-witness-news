The property mogul is accused of strangling his wife Susan Rohde at the Spier Wine Farm in Stellenbosch in 2016. CAPE TOWN - The State has accused alleged wife killer Jason Rohde of fabricating evidence to suit his version of events. The property mogul is accused of strangling Susan Rohde at the Spier Wine Farm in Stellenbosch in 2016, while they were there for a work function. He claims she committed suicide after a fight about his extra-marital affair with a colleague, who was also at the hotel that weekend. Rohde insists a hair iron cord was placed tightly around his wife’s neck when he found her in the bathroom of their hotel room. But the hotel handyman who removed the cord has testified it was placed loosely and easily came off.  The State has concluded that for the accused’s theory to be true, that Susan hanged herself, there would’ve had to have been a knot to keep it tight. Advocate Louis van Niekerk highlights that the evidence from a State pathologist supports the handyman’s testimony that there was no knot. Doctor Akmal Coetzee Khan in his post-mortem results found that the ligature mark around the deceased’s neck was incomplete. There was also no indication of a knot imprint. Van Niekerk says the State will argue that Rohde is lying and making up his version of events.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
