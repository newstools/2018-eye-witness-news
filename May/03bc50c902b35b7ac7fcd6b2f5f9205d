Chris Nikoi is commemorating one year since his wife’s body was discovered on Table Mountain. CAPE TOWN - The husband of a woman found dead on Table Mountain a year ago says getting details around her death will help bring some form of closure for the family. Ghanaian Charlotte Nikoi disappeared while hiking with her husband Chris Nikoi and their youngest daughter on 21 March last year. “There’s no way that she will be replaced in my life or in the life of our children.” Chris Nikoi is commemorating one year since his wife’s body was discovered on Table Mountain. He’s with Charlotte Nikoi’s family in Ghana and says he, their three daughters and the rest of the family are still dealing with her passing. “Our children are doing relatively okay, going about their business, schools and other things to the best of their abilities and we’re just taking it day by day.” The 50-year-old was on the Platteklip Gorge hiking trail with her husband and 17-year-old daughter, when she told them she’d proceed back down and wait for them there. They never saw her again. Police say the investigation into Nikoi’s death is yet to be finalised. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
