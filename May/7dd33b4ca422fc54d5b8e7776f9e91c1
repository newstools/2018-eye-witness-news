In the post, adverse claims are made about the embattled Cape Town mayor. News24 is reporting the post includes a picture of de Lille and the headline Patricia De Lille Exposed, before it lists alleged breaches she made, which relate to MyCiTi bus tenders. It's then purportedly signed by the Auditor General of South Africa. However, the Auditor General’s office denies signing the document. De Lille says she'll be taking further steps. “I will be laying charges tomorrow, criminal charges against the people who distributed this fake news.
