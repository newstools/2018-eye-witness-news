JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  says the coal shortage at some of its power stations has stabilised, with some showing signs of improvement. The utility has been experiencing major coal shortages  at six of its power stations in the past month. It was hoping that this would be reduced to five stations, but officials are still working on the situation. Eskom will also be contracting new coal suppliers to ensure there's adequate supply over the winter months. The utility's spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe says: “The future remains pretty much unchanged, we still have those six power stations that are having difficulty with coal stock levels. We still continue to get coal from the other power stations, diverting coal from the other power stations to these ones, so that we can keep the system running.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
