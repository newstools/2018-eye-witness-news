Ukraine on Thursday defended the action of its state security services in faking the death of a Russian dissident journalist after international criticism. KIEV - Arkady Babchenko, the journalist who faked his own death to evade what he says was a Russian plot to assassinate him, on Thursday said pig’s blood and a make-up artist were used to help stage the incident. In a joint interview in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Babchenko said he was taken away in an ambulance from the scene of his faked murder to a morgue, where he changed clothes and began watching the news. WATCH: Russian journalist: pig's blood, make-up artist helped fake his death  Ukraine on Thursday defended the action of its state security services in faking the death of a Russian dissident journalist after international criticism, saying the bizarre ruse had been essential for protecting him. Ukraine revealed on Wednesday that it had stage-managed the fake murder of Babchenko, a critic of the Kremlin who they said had been targeted by hitmen hired by Russia, to trace a trail back to Russia and expose plans for his, and other, state-sponsored assassinations. But some criticised the incident, which involved the phoney distribution of lurid details about his shooting and photographs showing him apparently lying in a pool of blood, as a stunt in poor taste which had sparked a false outpouring of grief and finger-pointing at Russia. Some said the operation had hurt Kiev’s credibility and played to Russian prejudices about Ukraine. “Relieved that Arkadiy #Babchenko is alive!” the office of the OSCE’s Harlem Desir tweeted. “I deplore the decision to spread false information on the life of a journalist. It is the duty of the state to provide correct information to the public.”
