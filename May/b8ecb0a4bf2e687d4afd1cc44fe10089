Yende was allegedly killed after her colleague David Ngwenya discovered her plans to report his involvement in copper theft. JOHANNESBURG – The family of murdered Eskom employee Thembisile Yende will walk to the East Rand substation where her body was found to mark the anniversary of the grim discovery. Yende was allegedly killed after her colleague David Ngwenya discovered her plans to report his involvement in copper theft. The 30-year-old's family say one year on, they are still unable to put the tragedy behind them. Yende's brother, Mboneni Yende, says delays in the case are worrying. “As the family, we’ve no relationship, none whatsoever, with Eskom. If Eskom was fair enough, by now we’d have found the killers.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
