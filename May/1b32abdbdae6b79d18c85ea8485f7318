The family believes Home Affairs was grossly negligent in repeatedly failing to issue the teenager with the correct documents to take part in soccer tours to Thailand and Dubai. CAPE TOWN - The Congolese mother of a 13-year-old boy who was twice prevented from playing soccer overseas due to the Home Affairs Department’s alleged bungling has told Parliament's Home Affairs Committee he now has another chance of playing abroad, this time in the United Kingdom. But George Maskini’s mother says the family first wants to be sure his travel documents will be in order as they don’t want him to experience the same trauma again. “We just want to give George the chance to be in this tournament. But because of these problems with his passports, we’re not sure. We don’t want to put him through this again.” Bampende Maskini has told the committee that the family intends suing Home Affairs. They believe the department was grossly negligent in repeatedly failing to issue the teenager with the correct documents to take part in soccer tours to Thailand and Dubai. In the latest incident, he was at the airport with his classmates when immigration officials told him his latest passport had been declared lost and stolen. This was after the intervention of Deputy Home Affairs Minister Fatima Chohan. Home Affairs officials have told the committee they’re investigating. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
