The Stormers back-rower will captain the Springboks for the first time in the absence of previous skippers, loose-forward Warren Whiteley and lock Eben Etzebeth, who have both been ruled out through injury. CAPE TOWN - Siya Kolisi has been named as captain of South Africa for the three-test home series against England next month, but the flanker will not lead the side against Wales on Saturday. The Stormers back-rower will captain the Springboks for the first time in the absence of previous skippers, loose-forward Warren Whiteley and lock Eben Etzebeth, who have both been ruled out through injury. The 26-year-old Kolisi will not be considered for Saturday’s international against Wales in Washington, however, with Stormers team mate Pieter-Steph du Toit wearing the armband for that fixture. Coach Rassie Erasmus announced an extended squad of 43 players for the June tests on Saturday and suggested he would take a number of fringe players to face Wales in the United States. “It’s a huge honour to captain the Springboks and Siya and Pieter-Steph are two honest, hardworking men who enjoy the respect of their fellow players,” Erasmus said in a media release from South African Rugby on Monday. “I believe both of them will do a good job as captains. My philosophy is that each player must take responsibility for his position and must therefore work extremely hard with that one goal in mind — to make the Springboks successful again.”  The Springboks host England at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on 9 June, before matches in Bloemfontein and Cape Town on the following Saturdays.
