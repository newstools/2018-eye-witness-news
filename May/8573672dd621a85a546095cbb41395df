The Reserve Bank placed VBS under curatorship in March when its liquidity problems meant it could no longer repay deposits to clients. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has opened a fraud case against officials at 15 municipalities that allegedly made illegal deposits with VBS Mutual Bank. The Reserve Bank placed VBS under curatorship in March when its liquidity problems meant it could no longer repay deposits to clients. The central bank found that VBS was not identifying and verifying customers’ details as required. The DA says the municipalities made deposits with VBS despite an instruction by the National Treasury against the practice. The DA’s Kevin Mileham said: “Municipalities are prohibited by law from banking their funds with mutual banks. They must bank them with a commercial bank, a bank registered in terms of a Banks Act. VBS is registered in terms of Mutual Banks Act. Their actions put municipal funds at risk.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
