Public hearings have been held across the country in the past few weeks to hear arguments from businesses and organisations, as well as to understand the reasons for Eskom's application. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  says it's hoping that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) will rule in its favour to help recover around R60 billion. Public hearings have been held across the country in the past few weeks to hear arguments from businesses and organisations, as well as to understand the reasons for Eskom's application. The power utility says this is not about applying for a tariff increase but rather about its regulatory clearing account. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says they expect Nersa to rule in the power producer’s favour. “We are now expecting the National Energy Regulator to make a determination before the end of June. They heard Eskom’s side of the story and the views of the general population in South African, including business. But for now, we are hopeful that the regulator will reimburse us the money that we require,” he said (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
