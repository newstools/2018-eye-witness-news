JOHANNESBURG - Former Orlando Pirates and KV Oostende player Andile Jali has denied reports that he has been arrested on drunk driving charges in Pretoria over the weekend. Various media reports had reported that Jali, who recently returned to South Africa following four years plying his trade with Belgium side KV Oostende, had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Pretoria on Saturday. Although the Tshwane Metro police have not made public the name of the arrested player, they did confirm that the detained driver had received a bail of R1,000 on Sunday and will appear in court on 15 May 2019. Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said that the reason for the 2019 court date is because of the blood test process. “I can confirm that the soccer player that was arrested by the Tshwane Metro Police was released on a bail of R1,000 and will appear in court on 15 May 2019. The reason for this is because the blood samples process can take up to a year to receive and present to court.” Jali, however, dismissed claims on his official Twitter page.
