CAPE TOWN - Experts are celebrating the positive impact that astronomy is having in Sutherland in the Northern Cape. Last week, scientists flocked to the town for the unveiling of the Meerlicht optical telescope which enables astronomers to take real-time images of astronomical events picked up by the Meerkat radio telescope outside Carnarvon. Before the rollout of the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in 2005, about 250 tourists visited Sutherland annually. Now, at least 12,000 visitors make their way to the area on a yearly basis. The project has also led to the establishment of 40 B&B's and 18 guest farms, up from only two B&B's before the facility. SALT's Science engagement manager Anthony Mietas says they're also involved in exposing learners to as many educational opportunities as possible. “We are quite involved in the schools. We are trying with some career counselling, we are trying to get the kids exposed to a little bit of university, open days [and] career possibilities for them.” Officials from the Science and Technology Department say programmes reached over 13,000 learners and around 15,000 students last year.
