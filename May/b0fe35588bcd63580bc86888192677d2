The committee will have to determine whether President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision earlier this month to place the province under administration is justified. CAPE TOWN - The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) has established an ad hoc committee to look into intervention taken in the North West province. The committee will have to determine whether President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision earlier this month to place the province under administration is justified. It has 180 days to report back to the NCOP on its determination. The ad hoc committee, to be chaired by the African National Congress’s Charel de Beer, says the committee has its work cut out for it and they must act with urgency. Members of Parliament agreed that their first order of business should be to meet with the inter-ministerial committee headed by Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The ad hoc committee will have to review the North West intervention regularly and make recommendations to the national executive. It will have to report back to the NCOP within 10 days of compiling its report on whether the intervention should be approved.
