Moyane is facing 12 charges of misconduct at the same time that he’s being investigated by the Hawks. In the latest exchange of legal letters between Moyane’s legal team and the State attorney, the suspended head of Sars is demanding that the inquiry headed by advocate Azhar Bham begin in the next few days. Moyane is also insisting that the president be called before the commission as a witness to explain why he’s lost confidence in him.
