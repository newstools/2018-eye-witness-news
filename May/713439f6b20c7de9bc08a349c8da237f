At least four taxi drivers are part of those who have been gunned down since the start of the weekend. CAPE TOWN – The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has condemned the taxi-related violence in Cape Town which has led to the deaths of nine people. At least four taxi drivers are part of those who have been gunned down since the start of the weekend. Three others have been wounded in these shootings. The Western Cape transport department has been meeting with various law enforcement agencies, the taxi sector,  and the Saps, in an effort to find a solution to the violence. The department says officers will be stationed at the taxi ranks in Delft, Wynberg, Langa, Claremont, and Cape Town station deck on Monday. Santaco's Philip Taaibosch says although he doesn't know what led the violence, the council finds it unacceptable.“Nobody should be using his platform within the taxi industry or even his might of being powerful or being moneyed to the extent of using people to kill each other.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
