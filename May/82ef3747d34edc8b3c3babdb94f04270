CAPE TOWN - The Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum Cluster (CPF) is taking a stand against fake news on social media and has introduced a new tagging system. The body says over the past few months, false voice notes and text messages have been circulated amid protests and community violence. The CPF's Rafique Foflonker says many residents have been raising concern over false messages on social media. Foflonker says their 3-S tag system works by asking those reporting incidents to identify themselves, the source and other details. “We are hoping to reduce the volume of fake news and old news that’s causing chaos, fear, and panic in the community. We [would] like to look at this as a mechanism to transform our society to be more responsible and intelligent when it comes to social media, and news and information.” The cluster has already started using the system and is encouraging residents to buy into the initiative.
