Transport MEC Ismail Vadi reopened the Tsakane taxi rank on Friday following a deadly shooting in which four people were killed this week. JOHANNESBURG - The days of taxis operating without the required permits in Gauteng are numbered. "In that particular region, we should sit down and really sort out what happened here because if a person or a group of people in the leadership have brought in illegal operators, they are eating into the business of the existing membership who have legal operating licences." Transport MEC Ismail Vadi reopened the Tsakane taxi rank on Friday following a deadly shooting in which four people were killed this week. The greater Brakpan Taxi Association, the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) Ekurhuleni regional council and the concerned group of drivers have signed a peace agreement. Eight security guards were arrested and 10 firearms recovered in the shooting earlier this week. Security and police visibility have since been increased in the Brakpan area. Vadi says the parties have agreed to operate in a peaceful environment. “Following other terms of the agreement is that one, that they will withdraw all security companies from taxi ranks so that they will be no armed security personnel at the taxi ranks. Two, they have committed themselves to declare the taxi ranks gun-free zones.”
