A series of hearings will determine whether some routes need to be closed down and will probe the conduct of taxi operators in Delft specifically. CAPE TOWN - Amid ongoing taxi violence, operators and authorities will be meeting over the next three weeks to try to put an end the conflict. A series of hearings will determine whether some routes need to be closed down and will probe the conduct of taxi operators in Delft  specifically. At least 10 people have been killed in taxi violence since Friday. Officials say the violence started on 11 May with the fatal shooting of two taxi drivers at the Delft Taxi Rank. From there, it spiralled out of control. Two weeks later, the chairperson of the Delft Taxi Association, Nazeem Daniels, was assassinated. Transport MEC Donald Grant has announced extraordinary measures to curb taxi violence, which may include the closure of ranks and routes to Delft and surrounds. “I’m giving notice of my intention based on evidence to close certain ranks and routes to shut them down.” Grant says a transport contingency plan will be implemented if ranks are shut down. The Transport Department will also appoint an independent mediator to try and resolve taxi-related violence in the area. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
