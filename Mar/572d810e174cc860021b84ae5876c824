The group says there has been on-going intimidation by Prasa security guards after activists demonstrated outside the agency’s Cape Town offices in January. CAPE TOWN - The Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) has refuted claims of intimidation and threats made by its staff against #UniteBehind activists. UniteBehind was granted an urgent interdict against Prasa by the Western Cape High Court earlier on Friday. The group says there has been on-going intimidation by Prasa security guards after activists demonstrated outside the agency’s Cape Town offices in January. But Prasa spokesperson Nana Zenani says this is not true. “There was a meeting that was disrupted by #UniteBehind members, chanting and singing. They were then escorted out without an incident, and then they got into an altercation with commuters. We challenge #UniteBehind to produce any sort of evidence contrary to that.” Zenani says Prasa plans on challenging the ruling. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
