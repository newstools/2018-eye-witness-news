Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to join Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy, according to media reports in England and the United States. LONDON - Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has terminated his contract with Manchester United with immediate effect, the Premier League club said in a statement on Thursday. Ibrahimovic is set to join Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy, according to media reports in England and the United States. “Everyone at the club would like to thank Zlatan for his contribution to the team since his arrival and wishes him well for the future,” United said on its website. The 36-year-old, who is Sweden’s record international goal-scorer with 62 strikes in 116 games, sustained a bad knee injury in last season’s Europa League quarter-final against Belgium’s Anderlecht. He last played for United on 26 December against Burnley.
