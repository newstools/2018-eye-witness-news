The Citizens comfortably beat Arsenal 3-0 in the League Cup Final played on Sunday. JOHANNESBURG - Arsenal host Manchester City at The Emirates stadium on Thursday evening in a repeat of the League Cup final that took place on Sunday. The Citizens comfortably beat Arsenal 3-0 in the final, with goals coming from Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and David Silva. City have not lost a game since their 4-3 defeat to Liverpool in January. A win on Thursday evening will leave Pep Guardiola’s men needing just five more victories to win the English Premier League title. Arsenal, however, will be hoping to narrow the gap to London rivals, Chelsea to just five points. A win would also see the Gunners narrow the gap to fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur to seven points – who still have to take on Manchester City and Chelsea respectively. Arsenal’s last league result was a 1-0 loss to rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, while City’s last league game saw them beat Leicester City 5-1. Kick-off on Thursday evening is at 9:45pm.
