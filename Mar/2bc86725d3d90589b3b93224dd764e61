The Democratic Alliance (DA) is now pleading with President Cyril Ramaphosa to prevent land invasions in the country. The party’s John Moodey says: “It’s becoming a national threat and therefore we call upon the powers, be at the national level especially president Cyril Ramaphosa, to bring back law and order and also to protect the rights of every South African citizen to possess and own land.” The DA is also accusing the Economic Freedom Fighters of encouraging people to break the law and illegally occupy land.
