The visiting Brazilians came storming out of the blocks when in form attacker Percy Tau won a penalty when he was brought down by Ouro-Akoriko inside the box. JOHANNESBURG â€“ Log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns beat Amazulu 3-1 to stretch their lead at the top of the Premiership table on Friday night at the King Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium. The visiting Brazilians came storming out of the blocks when in form attacker Percy Tau won a penalty when he was brought down by Ouro-Akoriko inside the box. Brazilian defender Ricardo Nascimento stepped up and calmly slotted the penalty home to give Sundowns a 1-0 lead in the 23rd minute of the game. Goalkeeper Brimah Razak then made a cardinal error 10 minutes later, when he failed to clear a back pass. Razak was under pressure and handled the ball, which resulted in an indirect freekick being awarded inside the box. Mhlengi Cele then fired past the congested box to level things up for Usuthu at half time. The visitors began the second half brightly and they deservedly restored their lead through Sibusiso Vilakazi following a good move by Pitso Mosimane's side. The South Africa international beat SuperSport United loanee Pule with a great finish to make it 2-1 to Sundowns in the 48th minute. The game was momentarily stopped when disgruntled supporters threw objects onto the field of play, but shortly after the resumption, Vilakazi got his double to put the result beyond doubt. Sundowns now have a seven point lead at the top of the table ahead of Pirates and Chiefs who will have the chance to cut that lead back down to four when they clash in the Soweto derby.
