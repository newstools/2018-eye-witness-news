The provincial traffic department on Thursday launched its Easter Safety plan. Traffic Chief Kenny Africa  has urged passengers to buckle up and not to exceed the speeding limit. Africa said: “Any vehicle that is equipped with a seatbelt, the driver and passengers of that vehicle must wear the seatbelt. What we experience in our roads, people tend to believe if they’re in a motor vehicle it’s only the driver and the front passenger that needs to wear the safety belt, everybody in the vehicle must use the safety belt."
