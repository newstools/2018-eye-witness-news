Officials say 28 suspects on the SAPS' wanted list have been apprehended. The Northern Cape Police spokesperson, Captain Olebogeng Tawana, says a suspect was also arrested after attempting to bribe police. “We also arrested a suspect who tried to bribe police with a R10,000 during the arrest.” Law enforcement officers seized two vehicles during roadblocks conducted. One vehicle was cloned and one’s engine number and chassis marks were tempered with.
