Addressing the media at Parliament on Monday evening, Minister Mildred Oliphant says her department no longer has control over the process to implement the R20 an hour minimum. CAPE TOWN - Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant has acknowledged that the 1 May implementation date for the national minimum wage might not be attainable. But she says the process is now entirely in the hands of Parliament. The portfolio committee on labour has over the past week been hearing public submissions on three bills which will give effect to the minimum wage. Addressing the media at Parliament on Monday evening, Oliphant says her department no longer has control over the process to implement the R20 an hour minimum. Oliphant says she personally briefed President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday that the deadline he announced last year as the then deputy president, won't be met. She says the implementation date announced by Ramaphosa last year February was always subject to the completion of the Parliamentary process. Oliphant says the process is now entirely in the hands of Parliament, but it has become evident that more time is needed to consider public submissions which are currently before the labour committee. But with Parliament going into recess this week, it's now become apparent that more time is needed to conclude the legislative process. “At this stage, we must all accept and allow the parliamentary processes to unfold without any undue interference. All the bills are now under the authority of Parliament and those who have views and opinions on the bills will have to approach Parliament as we, as the executive, no longer have control of these processes.” The department says it has not set a new deadline for implementation, but it's hoping the process will be concluded by mid-year.
