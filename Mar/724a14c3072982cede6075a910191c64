JOHANNESBURG - Japan's prime minister is warning North Korea's offer of denuclearisation talks with America  could be a ploy to play for time. In his first public comments since an apparent diplomatic breakthrough between North and South Korea, Shinzo Abe has cautioned that talking for the sake of talking is "meaningless". He's stressed the need for Pyongyang to take "concrete" steps. US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he saw “possible progress” regarding North Korea after South Korea said Pyongyang is willing to hold talks with the United States on denuclearisation and will suspend nuclear tests while discussions are underway. China also encouraged North and South Korea to continue their reconciliation efforts after a delegation from the South met with the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un.
