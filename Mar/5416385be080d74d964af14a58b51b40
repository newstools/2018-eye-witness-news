JOHANNESBURG - The Trade and Industry Department says it will sign the African Continent Free Trade Area agreement once important components have been finalised. Minister Rob Davies on Monday said that the country was fully committed to finalising the process after signing a declaration, supporting the establishment of the new trade deal. The department's deputy Director-General Xolelwa Mlumbi-Peter: "The reason South Africa only signed the declaration is due to legal processes, some of which we were not in a position to sign, so we could not sign on 21 March but we do intend to sign the agreement one al lthe critical components o he agreement have been finalised." President Cyril Ramaphosa last week held off on signing the actual agreement, until the relevant laws and regulations are in place.
