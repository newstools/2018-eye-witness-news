JOHANNESBURG - Proteas coach Ottis Gibson says that his young wicketkeeper batsman Quinton de Kock doesn’t deserved to be fined by the International Cricket Council for his involvement in the altercation with Australia’s David Warner at Kingsmead in Durban. Gibson says that CCTV footage clearly shows a different story to what the ICC have sanctioned De Kock for. “Quinny wasn’t being aggressive, I think we all saw the footage where somebody else was being held back and Quinny walking up the stairs and he gets a level 1, how is that fair?” Gibson says that De Kock was provoked by Warner and had he not been provoked he wouldn’t have said anything back. “The case is that Quinny wouldn’t have said anything had something not been said to him in the first place.” South Africa lost the first Test match against Australia by 118 runs and will play the second Test at St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth, knowing that victory will bring them right back into the four-match series.
