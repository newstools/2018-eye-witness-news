Paige will join the Cheetahs who are in contention for a Pro14 play-off position on a three-month deal. The 13 capped Springbok scrumhalf will provide cover for current incumbents Zee Mkhabela and Tian Meyer, while the other scrum-halves in the squad Shaun Venter and Ruan van Rensburg are sidelined due to injury.
