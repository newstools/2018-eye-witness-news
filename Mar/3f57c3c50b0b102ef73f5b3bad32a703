World 100m champion Justin Gatlin and former SA 200m record holder and 2015 World Championship 200m bronze medalist Anaso Jobodwana will come face-to-face on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG - World 100m champion, Justin Gatlin, and former South African 200m record holder and 2015 World Championship 200m bronze medalist, Anaso Jobodwana, will come face-to-face for the third time in their careers on Thursday at the Athletix Grand Prix Series Meeting at Tuks Stadium. The American is currently leading the head-to-headâ€™s 2-0. The first time they met was at the Pregontaine Meeting in Eugene, Oregon on 30 May 2015. The two came face-to-face again in the 200m final at the World Championships in Beijing that year. In Eugene, Gatlin raced away to a 19.68sec win to the second place of Jobodwana who clocked a then national record of 20.04sec. At the World Championships, it was again the American who edged Jobodwana as they finished second and third respectively in 19.74sec and 19.87sec behind Usain Bolt. For Jobodwana this will be the seventh race of 2018, while for Gatlin it will be his first of the season. Jobodwana has yet to lose a race this season and is coming back into the form that saw him run under 20sec for the 200m at the 2015 World Championships.
