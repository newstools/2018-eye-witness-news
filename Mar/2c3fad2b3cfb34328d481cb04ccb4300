JOHANNESBURG - Jacob Zuma may not get a fair trial, that's a concern raised by the uMkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association. The National Prosecuting Authority has decided to reinstate corruption charges  against the former president, setting the stage for yet another high-profile court battle involving him. The association's, Carl Niehaus, says the organisation is fully behind Zuma. “Because of the huge amount of negative publicity and anti-Zuma campaigning that has taken place in the public domain, there is a tsunami of anti-Zuma sentiments that will make it very difficult for Zuma to have a free and fair trial.”
