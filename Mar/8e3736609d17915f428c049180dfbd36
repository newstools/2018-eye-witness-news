JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in Johannesburg says its written to the Public Protector’s office requesting it to investigate irregular salary increases, appointments, and maladministration within the city. The ANC says there are several issues highlighted in its complaint, including that mayor Herman Mashaba seems to be at a conflict of interest. It says his wife is allegedly unduly benefitting from tenders that are issued within the city. A spokesperson for the ANC in Johannesburg, Jolidee Matongo, says this is not a campaign against Mashaba, but an interrogation into mismanagement in the city. “The Public Protector’s office said they will look into the matter, determine whether they have jurisdiction. They will give us a response next week as to which issues they will be able to investigate.”
