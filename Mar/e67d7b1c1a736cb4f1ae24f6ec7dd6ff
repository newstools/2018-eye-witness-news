JOHANNESBURG - Australian batsman and vice-captain David Warner has been cleared to play in the second Test match against the Proteas at St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth, after accepting his level 2 breach of ICC’s code conduct during the first Test in Durban. Warner and South African wicketkeeper batsman, Quinton de Kock were involved in a heated altercation on the staircase leading up to the players dressing room during the tea interval on Day 4. The International Cricket Council on Tuesday charged both Warner and De Kock for breaching the code of conduct. Warner had been charged with a level 2 offense, while De Kock had been charged with a level 1 misdemeanor. A Level 2 offence can warrant up to four demerit points being issued, which equates to an automatic suspension of one Test or two ODIs/T20I, whichever comes first. But Warner has accepted a sanction of three points, meaning he's free to play in the second Test in Port Elizabeth, which starts on Friday. The sanction has been received with mixed feelings on Twitter by both Australian and South African fans.
