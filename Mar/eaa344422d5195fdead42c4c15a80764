CAPE TOWN - Coca-Cola is planning to produce an alcoholic drink for the first time in the company’s 125-year history, with an alcopop-style product in Japan. It’s keen to cash in on the country’s growing taste for Chu-hi, a canned sparkling flavoured drink given a kick with a local spirit called Shochu. The product is typically between 3% and 8% alcohol by volume. A senior coke executive in Japan says the move was a “modest experiment” and adds it’s unlikely the drink would be sold outside of Japan. Chu-hi, an abbreviation for Shochu Highball, has been marketed as an alternative to beer, proving especially popular with female drinkers. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
