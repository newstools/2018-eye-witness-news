The couple took their vows in front of family and friends gathered on the structure dubbed the ‘coat hanger’, 134 metres above the city’s main harbour. SYDNEY - They met in passing while trying to lose weight but on Thursday Australian men Warren Orlandi and Pauly Phillips made history by becoming the first same-sex couple to get married on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The couple took their vows in front of family and friends gathered on the structure dubbed the “coat hanger”, 134 metres above the city’s main harbour, two days before the 40th anniversary of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. The wedding is a fitting personal milestone for Orlandi especially. When he began losing weight in 2013 he was more than 370kgs and set himself the goal of being fit enough to climb the famous bridge. He ultimately lost more than 250kgs. Australia became the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage in December 2017, a watershed moment in a country where some states held homosexual activity to be illegal until twenty years ago.
