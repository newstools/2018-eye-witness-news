He's one of three men who drowned during a baptism ceremony over the weekend. The bodies of two of the victims have been retrieved. The City of Cape Town's Wayne Dyason says: “SAPS indicted this morning that they would not resume with the search as the body could be anywhere, due to the tidal movements. An SAPS helicopter will do an area reconnaissance only.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
