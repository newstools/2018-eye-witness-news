JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic says that Mamelodi Sundowns and Soweto derby opponents Kaizer Chiefs are the real contenders for the title ahead of the all-important clash against Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. The two Soweto giants are separated by a point at second and third in the league standings, while they are still just four points adrift of leaders Sundowns. Pirates are arguably the form side going into the match, having dispatched Chippa United 4-2 on the weekend while Chiefs are coming off a goalless draw against Bloemfontein Celtic. Micho has played down that they are the form side going into the clash, saying that his team is still a work in progress. “The team that is leading the league has been with their coach for eight years and the team that we are playing against on Saturday has been with their coach for three years and coach Rulani and myself have been together for just eight months, so those two teams are the real favourites not us.” This weekends' derby will be the 163rd in its history and Chiefs have dominated the fixture, winning 67 times. Pirates have only won 38 of those clashes while the draws have crippled the contest in recent times with 52. A win for either side will cut down Sundowns lead and put significant pressure on the men from Pretoria. Kick-off at the FNB Stadium is at 15:30pm.
