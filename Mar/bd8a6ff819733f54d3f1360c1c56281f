President Cyril Ramaphosa says the YES initiative is a result of a social compact responding to social ills. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says that the Youth Employment Service (YES) launched in Midrand on Tuesday will change the lives of young South Africans across the country. Ramaphosa launched the initiative, which has brought together business, labour, civil society and government on Tuesday morning. The program aims to create about one million job internships over three years, targeting mainly black South Africans between the ages of 18 and 35.  Ramaphosa says the YES initiative is a result of a social compact responding to social ills. “We want it to spread throughout the country; the towns, villages as well as rural areas.”   (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
