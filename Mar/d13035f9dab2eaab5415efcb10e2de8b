Its emerged that Kamwendo was to be replaced on the show but had not been officially informed by management. While details are not clear, it’s alleged management was unhappy that she explained the events leading up to the end of the show. Sanef's media freedom sub-committee chairperson Sam Mkokeli says its disturbed with the silencing of Kamwendo’s voice. “When a broadcaster is being silenced, that is censorship. We’ve seen that happening in the past and don’t want the broadcaster to go back to the painful past, which was the norm under Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s leadership.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
