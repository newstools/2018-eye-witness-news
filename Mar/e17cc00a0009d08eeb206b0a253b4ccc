Normalised headline EPS, the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out one-off items, came in at 2,719 cents in the year ended December compared with a 2,527 cents a year earlier. JOHANNESBURG - South African insurer Liberty Holdings reported an 8% rise in annual profit on Friday, a sign that a turnaround strategy under a new chief executive is bearing fruit. Normalised headline EPS, the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out one-off items, came in at 2,719 cents in the year ended December compared with a 2,527 cents a year earlier. Liberty, a unit of lender Standard Bank, is in the middle of a turnaround plan that includes greater focus on higher margin products and slower offshore expansion under new chief executive David Munro, who took the reigns almost a year ago from Thabo Dloti. Dloti resigned after clashing with the board over his acquisition-fueled expansion strategy across Africa at the expense of what Standard Bank has said was the neglect of the vast, largely untapped lower-income market at home. â€œWe are confident that the group will emerge from this period of change with significantly greater potential to serve the needs of all stakeholders, the company said.
