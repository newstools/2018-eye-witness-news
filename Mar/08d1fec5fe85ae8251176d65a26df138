Deputy President David Mabuza says it’s disappointing that racism still exists in South Africa even after so many years. JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President David Mabuza says racial attacks among the people of South Africa show that the lives of those who were killed during apartheid were lost for nothing. Mabuza was speaking in Sharpeville at a Human Rights Day event. The event was to commemorate the 69 people who were killed in 1960 by the apartheid police, who opened fire during a peaceful march against pass laws. Mabuza says it’s disappointing that racism still exists in South Africa even after so many years. “We’re called upon to work together to advance Human Rights, inclusion and unity. We must create a world free from the evil clutches of racism and social exclusion.” The deputy president says cases and incidents of racism show that South Africa is not yet entirely free. “It’s an indictment on all of us that some many years after Sharpeville we still witness racial attacks” Mabuza was referring to cases such as that of former real estate agent Vicki Momberg, who was found guilty on four counts of crimen injuria. Mabuza says generations to come should be reminded of the struggle to free millions of South Africans from the apartheid rule. He says the anti-apartheid movement was about achieving equality. “At the heart of all these campaigns against the indignity of passes was a struggle for equality and citizenship.” Mabuza says former leaders would be devastated when hearing about what is happening to children. Mabuza was referring to children who died after falling into pit toilets in schools, saying things there need to be changed. “Such a tragedy exposes our neglect of children and abuse of Human Rights that Tambo and Mukaba fought for.”
