South Africa will be hoping to get more points on the board, having only scored 130 points in Las Vegas compared to France with 154 – the most over the weekend. JOHANNESBURG - The Springbok Sevens team will be hoping to increase the ten point gap between them and New Zealand this weekend in the Vancouver leg of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series. The Blitzboks finished fourth in the previous leg in Las Vegas, going down to Argentina in the semi-finals and then losing 26-22 to Fiji in the 3rd/4th place play-off. It was a disappointing weekend for both South Africa and New Zealand, as the they finished in fifth. South Africa will be hoping to get more points on the board, having only scored 130 points in Las Vegas compared to France with 154 – the most over the weekend. That may be remedied by better kicking from the Blitzboks, having 22 tries in Vegas, second to France with 24. Only ten of the Blitzboks 22 tries were converted. Phillip Snyman and his young soldiers will have to learn from their fourth-place finish in Las Vegas. The team seemed out of sorts at times, especially in the game against Wales and Argentina. A huge chunk of the team is absent due to injury and Super Rugby duty, which will put pressure on the young players in the team. The experienced members of the squad will also have to manage their younger teammates. The Blitzboks get their Vancouver Sevens leg underway on 7:52pm on Saturday evening. They then take on Scotland at 11:24pm. In the match of the group, South Africa take on New Zealand on Sunday morning at 2:56am. All times are CAT.
