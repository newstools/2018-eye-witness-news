At least 180 people have died from the food-borne disease since January last year and over 940 cases have been reported so far. Momi Oliphant has spoken out for the first time about what happened at her daycare centre when nine children suddenly fell ill after she fed them polony. “Polony ... I don’t even want to know the colour of that thing. We have resorted to either noodles or something that is nutritional, like today it was vegetables. But [not] polony.” Oliphant says she's relieved that none of the children lost their lives. “Some people lost their lives. We were so fortunate. The kids were immediately rushed to the clinic.” The elderly woman has been running the daycare centre for 23 years and says she's never experienced anything like this before.
