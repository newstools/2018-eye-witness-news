Phakeng is set to officially take up the position from the 1 July this year. Provincial ANC spokesperson, Yonela Diko, says Professor Phakeng has already shown a clear understanding of what is at the core of the campus challenges. “We are therefore confident that once at the helm of the university she will ensure that the university continues to rise is global rankings, she will ensure that the quality of professors and researchers at the university continue to improve and that its lecturers continue to be world-class.”
