Quinton de Kock and David Warner had both been charged by ICC match referee Jeff Crowe with level 1 and level 2 charges respectively. JOHANNESBURG - Quinton de Kock and the Proteas management have decided to contest the level 1 charge by the ICC for bringing the game into disrepute for his involvement in the fracas involving David Warner in Durban. De Kock and Warner had both been charged by ICC match referee Jeff Crowe with level 1 and level 2 charges respectively. Warner has since accepted his charge and has been fined 75% of his match fee, and in the process, escapes a one-match ban. For De Kock his level 1 breach means that a maximum of a 50% fine and two demerit points, half the amount of points needed to be suspended for either one Test or two limited-overs matches, whichever comes first. The wicket-keeper has decided to contest the charge and is set to appear in front of an ICC hearing on Wednesday night in Port Elizabeth.
