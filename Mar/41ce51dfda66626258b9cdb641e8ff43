JOHANNESBURG - The Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee will sit on Wednesday 15 March to hear the protests from Orlando Pirates and SuperSport United against Ajax Cape Town for fielding striker Tendai Ndoro. Ajax Cape Town fielded Ndoro against Orlando Pirates on 31 January 2018 and against SuperSport United on 28 February 2018. Both clubs are protesting the eligibility of Ndoro. Ndoro has signed for three clubs this season alone, having represented Orlando Pirates at the beginning of the season before being sold to Al-Faisaly of Saudi Arabia prior to the close of the previous transfer window. The Zimbabwean striker then joined Ajax during the January transfer window, making the Urban Warriors his third club of the season. Fifa rules state that a player may sign for three clubs within one season but can only don the jersey of two of those clubs.
