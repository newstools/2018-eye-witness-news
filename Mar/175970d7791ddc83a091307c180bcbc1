JOHANNESBURG - Lions and Springbok flanker Jaco Kriel has suffered a setback to his shoulder operation and will have to have another one on 8 March. Kriel had sustained the shoulder injury in the Rugby Championship game against Australia on September 9th, 2017 which had initially ruled him out for six months. He was expected to make his return to the playing field in early 2018 but the Lions Rugby Union has confirmed that his initial operation was unsuccessful and that he will have to go under the knife again. It is unclear for how long the setback will keep the flanker out for.
