President Cyril Ramaphosa made changes to his Cabinet earlier this week, firing 10 ministers and moving some existing ones to other departments. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) member Ronald Lamola has criticised President Cyril Ramaphosa for failing to include more young people in his Cabinet. Ramaphosa made changes to his Cabinet earlier this week, firing 10 ministers and moving some existing ones to other departments. Lamola was one of the young NEC members who was expected to be deployed in government, but that didn’t happen. He says he agrees with the ANC Youth League (ANCYL), which says that it’s unhappy that Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet doesn’t have young people. “You can’t have a youthful nation with youthful challenges and then not have youthful people to address those issues.” He says he doesn’t think Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet will be helpful for the future. While Lamola says he can’t confirm or deny if he was approached to go to Cabinet, he says he hasn’t ruled out joining the government in a year’s time.   (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
