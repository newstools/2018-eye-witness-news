One of the issues is the recusal of panellist Sheila Camerer, who Patricia de Lille has described as a ‘known political opponent’. CAPE TOWN - A closed-door disciplinary panel discussion to probe misconduct charges against Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille is still going ahead. Deliberations on procedural details of the disciplinary process continued after a break. De Lille’s legal team assessed how the panel members were appointed as well as the specific role each of them will fulfil. Nearly 10 hours after proceedings started, officials were still debating procedural matters that will guide the disciplinary process going forward. One of the issues is the recusal of panellist Sheila Camerer, a former Deputy Justice Minister, whom De Lille has described as a “known political opponent”. De Lille also wants a complete list of witnesses who will testify. She says the Democratic Alliance only gave them two names. “I didn’t speak at all… it was just the lawyers talking about the technical points they want to clear first; how was the panel appointed, for instance.” One witness who’s confirmed that he’ll testify during the proceedings is Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson.
