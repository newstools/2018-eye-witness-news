JOHANNESBURG – President Cyril Ramaphosa was spotted flying economy class on a domestic flight on Friday. A snapshot of the President that’s been shared on Twitter, shows the Number One citizen sitting in the window seat of a SAfair flight to Durban.  Twitter users have reacted to the picture, applauding Ramaphosa for saving taxpayers’ money by choosing a more ‘cost effective’ way to travel.    The President has won some hearts by promoting himself as accessible and keen to be amongst the masses. At the beginning of the year, Ramaphosa began walking community members in the Western Cape and then in Gauteng, adding that the exercise allows him to interact with ordinary South Africans and learn about their plights first hand.
