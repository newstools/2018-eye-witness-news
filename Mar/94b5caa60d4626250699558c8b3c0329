JOHANNESBURG - Proteas captain Faf du Plessis says that both Australian vice-captain David Warner and wicket-keeper batsman Quinton de Kock got personal with each other on the field of play. Du Plessis referred to an incident which was caught on CCTV footage during the first Test at Kingsmead Stadium in Durban, where Warner and Du Kock were engaging in a heated verbal exchange in the player's tunnel at the tea break on Day 4. It is alleged that De Kock made utterances about Warner’s spouse, Candice, which prompted an emotional response by Warner as the players made their way into their respective changing rooms. Other reports also alleged that Warner, himself, had made comments about De Kock’s mother and sister and also called him a "bush pig". Du Plessis says that both parties got a little personal with each other and that the situation should not have spilt over off the field of play. “I think both parties from what I have heard got a bit personal with each other, but I don’t know what was said and I think that’s what made it go off the field. If you want to go personal, and that is us included, then it needs to stay on the field.” South Africa lost the first Test by 118 runs, Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc was named Man of the Match after taking match figures of 9/109.
