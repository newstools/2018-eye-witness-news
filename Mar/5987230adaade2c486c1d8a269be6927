QUESTIONS AROUND JACOBS Earlier EWN reported that National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole had become embroiled in a plan to have internal complaints withdrawn against the new head of crime intelligence before the appointment was made official. It's understood that there are at least four pending internal complaints against Jacobs. EWN has seen a letter sent to Sitole by Western Cape Crime Intelligence head Mzwandile Tiyo. The provincial head has lodged several complaints against Jacobs. Tiyo recounts how he was summoned to a meeting on Monday by two of Sitole’s deputies - apparently on the general’s instructions – in which he was requested to withdraw the complaints against Jacobs. He was asked to instead settle the disputes through a reconciliation process.
