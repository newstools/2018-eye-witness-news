JOHANNESBURG - Former South African Schools captain Salman Moerat will make his Super Rugby debut for the Stormers when the Cape side plays the last game of its Australasian tour against the Highlanders on Friday. Moerat is one of five changes to the side that went down 45-28 to the Crusaders in Christchurch. The only change to the backline sees Dillyn Leyds move back to wing to make way for the returning Damian Willemse, with Seabelo Senatla ruled out due to a groin strain and JJ Engelbrecht providing cover among the replacements. Up front, Kobus van Dyk will start at blindside flank in the absence of Cobus Wiese, who is nursing a shoulder injury. There is an all-new lock pairing in Jan de Klerk and Chris van Zyl, with JD Schickerling having returned home injured and both Pieter-Steph du Toit and the 20-year-old Moerat set to provide impact off the replacements bench. Du Toit is recovering from concussion and has been bracketed with George Whitehead. The only change to the front row sees Steven Kitshoff back in the starting XV, with JC Janse van Rensburg on the replacements bench.
