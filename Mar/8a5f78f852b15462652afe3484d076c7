Maimane visited different voting stations around Gauteng on Saturday with Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has urged South Africans to hold every political party to account when they vote in next year's general elections. Maimane visited different voting stations around Gauteng on Saturday with Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. Maimane has also called on young South Africans to vote following low number of youth votes in the 2016 local elections. He says citizens should compare the governance of each political party to make an informed decision. “This is the first elections where I believe that we can have an assessment of what the ANC government has done. Compare governments. If you look at what the DA government is doing, you can see corruption is being eradicated and unemployment is being decreased.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
