The Water and Sanitation Department says it is significant as the rest of the country battles with a shortage of water. JOHANNESBURG – The Vaal Dam has reached its full capacity with levels hitting the 100% mark. The last time the dam was this full was in February last year. The Water and Sanitation Department says it is significant as the rest of the country battles with a shortage of water. Two weeks ago, the Cooperative Governance Minister Zweli Mkhize declared the water crisis a national state of disaster. The Water Department's spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says the recant rain has added to the Vaal Dam. “We’re still in a very comfortable situation and doesn’t require us to actually do any releases as well as considering that we’re reaching the end of our rainy season.”
