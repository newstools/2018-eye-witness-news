JOHANNESBURG- The South African Sevens side finished third at the Vancouver Sevens tournament in Canada, after a semi-final defeat to tournament winners Fiji. The Blitzboks beat Russia 38-7 and Scotland 21-0 before going down 33-14 to New Zealand in their final pool game. Neil Powell’s men then had to rally back from 19-0 to Australia in the quarter-final, before running out 24-19 winners and set up a last four clash with Fiji. The Flying Fijians proved to be a little too strong for the Blitzboks, running out 15-12 winners and became the only side this season to win two tournament titles when they beat a valiant Kenya side 31-12 in the Cup final. The Blitzboks maintained their eight-point lead over the Fijians in the overall standings with a third-place finish after beating the USA 29-7. Neil Powell says that they need to get better at closing out the tight matches, “Against Fiji we had the opportunity to beat them, but did not, so that is something we need to get better at. Against teams like that, you get that one chance and you must use it. Against the USA, it was the ideal opportunity to give the younger guys a chance and they responded very well. There were mistakes made, but that is how you learn, and I was impressed by their efforts.”
