The Blues have now been beaten in their last 13 meetings with the Chiefs, the longest winless streak between two teams in the history of the competition. The Blues opened the scoring with a converted try in the 8th minute courtesy of Augustine Pulu and Bryn Gatland for the extra two points. Taleni Seu responded five minutes later for the Chiefs after an offload from Sean Wainui following a scrum. Damian Mckenzie missed the subsequent conversion. Akira Ioane then crossed the whitewash for the hosts, extending their lead to nine points following another successful conversion from Gatland. Another unconverted try from the Chiefs, courtesy of Sean Wainui, saw the teams go into the break 14-10 in favour of the Blues. The Chiefs were out of the blocks quickly in the second half, scoring three minutes in, courtesy of Sam Cane. Damian McKenzie converted and - in the process - got the visitor’s first points from the boot. Brad Weber touched down for the Chiefs a couple minutes later after a poor pass from Melani Nanai 51 minutes in and the Chiefs lead 24-14. A penalty from Damian Mckenzie put the visitors ahead by 13 points with just under twenty minutes remaining. Bryn Gatland then scored a try. The conversion allowed for a tense final quarter with just six points separating the teams. Despite conceding seven penalties, to the Chiefs’ ten, the Blues lost the game 21-27.
