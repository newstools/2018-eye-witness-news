JOHANNESBURG - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has upheld its decision to slap Quinton de Kock with a level 1 sanction for bringing the game into disrepute in his involvement in the stairway altercation with Australia’s David Warner during the tea break on Day 4 of the first Test at Kingsmead in Durban. CCTV footage showed Warner and De Kock involved in a heated altercation in the stairway leading up to the players' dressing room. Warner had to be restrained by his teammates after De Kock allegedly made unsavory comments about his wife Candice Warner. De Kock decided to contest his charge on Wednesday and came before the ICC’s disciplinary hearing, where cricket’s governing body upheld its original decision. De Kock was fined 25% of his match fee and handed one demerit point. The second Test starts at St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth on Friday morning.
