The company says the recall is due to listeria monocytogenes found in the single batch, but it insists itâ€™s not related to the recent listeria recall related to Enterprise Foods. JOHANNESBURG - The Shoprite Group has recalled a batch of Farmer's Deli red Viennas from its shelves after finding listeria in one of the batches. The group says further testing needs to be done to confirm the presence of harmful levels of the bacteria which will take another five working days. On Thursday, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the government expects infections from the worst listeria outbreak in history to increase. Some 180 people have died since January 2017. While Enterprise Products have been removed from shelves, another brand Farmer's Deli will face a recall of its red Viennas from the Shoprite Group. The group made the announcement on Friday afternoon, saying while it waits for confirmation results it has taken precautionary measures removing all Farmer's Deli red and smoked Viennas from its shelves until the product gets cleared. In an announcement, the Shoprite Group says the Winelands District environmental health practitioner found the presence of listeria in an initial testing of a single batch of red Viennas. It does, however, say the Listeria monocytogenes is not linked to the recent listeria ST6 recall related to enterprise foods.
