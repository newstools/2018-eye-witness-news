President Cyril Ramaphosa was speaking to Soweto residents after concluding his 5km walk. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says he has hope that the party’s head of elections, Fikile Mbalula, will help them retain the majority during the general elections next year.  He says it was not a mistake to remove him from Cabinet. Ramaphosa was speaking to Soweto residents after concluding his 5km walk. The president says Mbalula has not been demoted in the ANC but entrusted with the responsibility to have Africa’s oldest liberation movement retain power. “When we said get out of the Cabinet and run elections, some people thought that we were mad. But are absolutely right, because he is the person who will win us our elections.” Wearing his #thumamina cap, meaning ‘send me’, he assured residents that rooting out corruption tops his agenda. “We are rooting out the corrupt elements in our state-owned enterprises. We are going to create a South Africa that all of us can be proud of.” He has also assured residents that his government will not allow any family or people to capture the state.
