The win for Polokwane City sees them rise to 11th on the log, three points clear of the drop zone, whilst Bloemfontein Celtic remain in 9th, below Wits on goal difference. JOHANNESBURG - Bloemfontein Celtic hosted Polokwane City at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on Wednesday evening. A win for Siwelele would see them break into the top 8, whilst a win for Platinum Stars would lift them out of the drop zone. After a slow opening quarter, Thaiso Semenya scored against the run of play, scoring inside the first 30 minutes. Eight minutes later controversy struck the game. Marvin Sikhosana rose high after corner who headed straight down the keeper’s throat. Amour Patrick Tignyemb however, seemed to carry the ball over the line and a goal was allowed. There is still a debate on whether the whole ball crossed the entire line. The teams went into the break with Polokwane 2-0 up. Ill-discipline seemed to be the name of the game for Rise and Shine, as they picked up five yellow cards. Goal scorer, Marvin Sikhosana was booked for simulation in the 62nd minute, reducing the visitors to ten men for the rest of the game. While City were more accurate, having five shots on target from their nine total shots in the game, Celtic seemed to have lost their shooting boots with 22 shots at goal, and just four of those on target. Perhaps, that was due to the constant fouls from the visitors – committing 19 fouls in the match. Discipline is clearly an issue for Polokwane City, who have committed almost forty fouls in their last three games. The win for Polokwane City sees them rise to 11th on the log, three points clear of the drop zone, whilst Bloemfontein Celtic remain in 9th, below Wits on goal difference. Both teams have a game in hand over Cape Town City and Baroka FC in 6th and 7th place respectively. The PSL returns on 16 March, with Nedbank Cup action taking place this weekend.
