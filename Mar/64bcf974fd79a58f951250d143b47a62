JOHANNESBURG- Blue Bulls head coach John Mitchell has named an unchanged squad for the derby clash against the Lions at Loftus on Saturday. The men from Pretoria beat the Hurricanes 21-19 in their season opener at Loftus last week Saturday and have opted for continuity against a high-flying Lions team. Springbok fullback Warrick Gelant was the late withdrawal last week due to a knee injury and Mitchell says that he will not rush him back to action. Meanwhile, Lions Coach Swys de Bruyn has made a few changes to the team that will take on Argentine side the Jaguares 47-27 at Emirates Airline Park. Springbok lock Franco Mostert will pack down on the blindside flank in a surprise move as regular starter Kwagga Smith is on compassionate leave this weekend. Marvin Orie comes into the second row to face up against his former side, while Rohan Janse van Rensburg makes his first start of the season in place of Harrold Vorster at inside centre.
