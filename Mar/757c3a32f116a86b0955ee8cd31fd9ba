The congress, which takes place every three years, is going to be held in Tshwane and is envisaged to be the largest the party has ever hosted. JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) has announced a list of members nominated for new leadership in the party ahead of its federal congress next month. The congress, which takes place every three years, is going to be held in Tshwane and is envisaged to be the largest the party has ever hosted - with over 2000 delegates expected to be in attendance. The DA says it is hosting the congress in Tshwane next month, symbolic of its plans to take over the Union Buildings in the coming national elections. The party’s chief electoral officer Anchen Dreyer says the congress will take place over the weekend of the seventh of next month and the elected members will be announced on Sunday afternoon. Dreyer says the positions of chairperson and federal leader will go uncontested. “Then the last position, I’m sure that’s one you’ve been waiting for, federal leader, we’ve one nomination only, so that’s Mmusi Maimane. He’s therefore elected unopposed, there are no other candidates for the position of the federal leader.” She says more than just a congress this will be a celebration of its growth since 2015. The party has nominated 46 candidates in its upcoming elections for a new leadership body. Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip, Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga, DA member of Parliament and Free State chairperson Annelie Lotriet are all vying for the federal chairperson position. Dreyer says she is extremely happy with the nomination process for the party's new leadership. “I’m actually very confident because up to now, everything has run very smoothly and we’ve had no appeals or anything like that with all the provincial congresses that have been held and also with the nomination process so far with all the candidates. Everything has been vetted and approved. So it’s been smooth-running up to now.”
