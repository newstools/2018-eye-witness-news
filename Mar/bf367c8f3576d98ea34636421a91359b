JOHANNESBURG - Springbok fullback Warrick Gelant will make his first Super Rugby start of the season for the Bulls when they take on the Queensland Reds at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday morning. Gelant had withdrawn from the side that beat the Hurricanes 21-19 in their season opener due to a knee injury, while he was included on the bench for their 45-28 defeat to the Lions last Saturday. Gelant replaces Divan Rousouw at fullback who drops to the bench, while there are positional switches for Handre Pollard and Jonny Kotze. Pollard moves from inside center into the fly half birth with Marnitz Boshoff moving to the bench and Kotze moves further infield from the wing into the 12 jersey. In the forwards line, co-captain Nick de Jager comes in at eighth man with Handro Liebenberg shifting to the blind side flank, with Thembelani Bholi falling out of the match day squad. Another Springbok, Trevor Nyakane, joins the match day squad for the first time this season, who is included on the bench. Kick-off at the Suncorp Stadium is at 10:45am.
