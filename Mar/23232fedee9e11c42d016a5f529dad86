Julius Malema says when they arrived in Parliament the EFF made sure that former president Jacob Zuma was held accountable for money he owed to the country. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says South Africa would not be where it is today if it was not for his party’s role in the country’s politics. Malema is addressing members of the EFF at the party’s election registration campaign at the Standard Bank Arena in Johannesburg.  He says when they arrived in Parliament the EFF made sure that former president Jacob Zuma was held accountable for money he owed to the country and pushed for his removal in office. “We moved from ‘Payback the Money’ to ‘Zupta Must Fall’... but before we moved, Zuma had paid back the money. Now we say ‘Zupta Must Fall’ after the Constitutional Court said Zuma is a Constitutional delinquent. Today, we say Zuma is history.”  Malema has reiterated the party’s call to remove the Democratic Alliance (DA) leader and Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Athol Trollip through a motion of no confidence. “All white people who are voting for the DA; who are angry with what we’re going to do in Port Elizabeth... who have insulted us since we announced this decision and mobilised some of their people in the media to insult us, all of you combined can go to hell.”
