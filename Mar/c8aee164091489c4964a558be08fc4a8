Fikile Mbalula says the party wants to deal with unemployment, crime and corruption among other issues as it heads to the 2019 elections. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says its campaign goal for the upcoming 2019 national elections is to achieve an overwhelming victory. The party is holding a two-day workshop at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg. Among those attending is former president Jacob Zuma.  The ANC’s Head of Elections, Fikile Mbalula, says the party wants to deal with unemployment, crime and corruption among other issues as it heads to the 2019 elections. “The people of South Africa are looking forward to a united ANC, that’s not at war with itself.” Mbalula says the ANC is also working on uniting its structures.  “The message that will be coming from the workshop will be very clear; it is not and cannot be business as usual.” Zuma smiled and laughed as the media took pictures and videos of him.  UNITED The ANC says it's planning to go into the 2019 national elections united and not at war with itself. The ANC lost three key Metros for the first time since the dawn of South Africa’s democracy in the local government elections in 2016. Mbalula says should the opportunity arise for the ANC to govern the Metro’s they're open to talks of coalitions. “The ANC is open to that... that includes all other Metros.”
