Union members are calling for Premier Supra Mahumapelo to step down, while members of the ANCYL are marching in his defence. JOHANNESBURG - Police have fired rubber bullets after marchers taking part in Nehawu’s North West day of action were confronted by a crowd dressed in African National Congress (ANC) T-shirts outside the legislature in Mahikeng.  Union members are calling for Premier Supra Mahumapelo to step down, while members of the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) are marching in his defence.  A small crowd wearing ANC T-shirts arrived carrying placards in defence of the premier, reading: “Hands off our premier.” Police fired rubber bullets when the two groups clashed, driving the ANCYL out of the Garona Building Square. The ANCYL’s representative Ofentse Bogopane says as a member of the tripartite alliance, Nehawu should not take to the streets. “We must call a meeting with the African National Congress and say that we’re having a problem with a deployee in government, who is Supra Mahumapelo and resolve the matter.” Nehawu leaders have called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene.
