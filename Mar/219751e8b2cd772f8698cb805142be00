Media reports say Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has interests in a supplement company which is a supplier of supplements to the national rugby team. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Rugby Union (Saru) has denied media reports that Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus – and other SARU officials – have any involvement in any procurement of supplement providers. Media reports say that Erasmus has interests in a supplement company which is a supplier of supplements to the national rugby team. These claims have raised questions as to whether there is a conflict of interest present in the rugby union. SA Rugby said: “The allegations are entirely untrue. Neither of them is invested, owning or earning anything from IT companies or nutritional companies supplying SA Rugby or otherwise.” Erasmus was revealed as Springbok coach on 1 March 2018. His first match in charge is against Wales on the 2 June 2018.
