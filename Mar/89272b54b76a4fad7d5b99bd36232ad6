Bannister became the first man to break the four-minute mile when he clocked 3 minutes 59.4 seconds at a sports ground in Oxford on 6 May 1954. LONDON - British athlete Roger Bannister, the first man to run a mile in under four minutes, has died aged 88, British media reported on Sunday, citing a statement from his family. Bannister became the first man to break the four-minute mile when he clocked 3 minutes 59.4 seconds at a sports ground in Oxford on 6 May 1954. British Prime Minister Theresa May led the tributes to the former athlete. “Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed,” she said on Twitter. The Briton, who also set a British record on route to the 1,500 metres final at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, was helped by pacesetters Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher during his record-breaking run. Australian John Landy surpassed Bannister’s record just a month later with a time of 3:57.9. Bannister also won gold at the Commonwealth Games later that year before retiring from athletics to pursue medical studies full-time. He became a neurologist. The current mile record was set by Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj, who set a time of 3:43.13 in Rome on 7 July 1999. Bannister was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2011.
