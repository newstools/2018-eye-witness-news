The department has emphasised that nobody is being attacked in the land debate, adding that the country's diplomatic channels remain open to those who seek clarity policy positions. The departments Ndivhuwo Mabaya said: “The minister of international relations has welcomed the communication we have from Australia that indicates that the statement made by the home affairs minister in relation to immigration in that country is not in line with their country and they will remain in line with their policy when they deal with immigrants.”
