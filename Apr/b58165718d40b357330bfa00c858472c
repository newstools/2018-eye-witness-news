JOHANNESBURG - The Blue Bulls have altered their loose forward combination for their encounter with the Queensland Reds at Loftus Versveld on Saturday afternoon. Bulls coach John Mitchell had to tweak his loose trio combination due to an injury to Hanro Liebenberg, with Marco van Staden moving from the side to the back of the scrum and Roelof Smit starting in the number six jersey again in the only change to the starting team in Durban last weekend. Smit, who started on the bench in that match, Van Staden and Thembelani Bholi will start together as a combination for the first time this season, although they did so for most of the match in Durban after Liebenberg left the field injured. Mitchell included Shaun Adendorff on the bench. Adendorff will make a first appearance for the Bulls this year. Bulls:15. Warrick Gelant14. Johnny Kötze13. Jesse Kriel12. Burger Odendaal (c)11.
