North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has reiterated that he believes that he is the subject of a smear campaign. JOHANNESBURG – North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has reiterated that he believes that he's being targeted after he called for a probe into irregularities and allegations of corruption in the provincial government, even before his tenure. Calls for Mahumapelo to step down or be removed as premier have sparked violent protests that have so far left three people dead. The African National Congress's (ANC) national structures, including president Cyril Ramaphosa, have intervened.

Three out of four high-level meetings in the province apparently collapsed  on Thursday.
