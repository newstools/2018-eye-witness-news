The online portal for grade one and eight pupils went live on Monday. The department says the registration system has been running smoothly.

It’s all systems go.” Applications will close at the end of May. Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi on Monday urged parents to apply as soon as possible. “Don’t wait for 28 May when it’s the last day of registrations. By the end of this afternoon, our top 50 schools will be removed because they’ll be full by then.” This year the department has roped in experts to help make the process easier for parents.
