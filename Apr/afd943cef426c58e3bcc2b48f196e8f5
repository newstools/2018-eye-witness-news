CAPE TOWN – The Western Province Cricket Association is to review security at Newlands cricket ground following a recent robbery. A group of 18 armed men targeted the sports venue last weekend. With this being the third robbery at Newlands Cricket Ground since 2015, the association says it’s concerned. Management will now assess security measures. In the early hours of Saturday, three men managed to jump over a perimeter fence after a security guard was distracted by a woman who'd asked for directions. The trio were then joined by 15 others who forced guards to hand over keys to the president's suite. The gun-wielding robbers then broke into 25 suites making off with televisions, alcohol and various other items.
