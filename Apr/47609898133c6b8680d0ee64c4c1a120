The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) says employers are standing firm on their wake offer of 9% for 11 months for the first year and then 8% for the second. The union says employers have given an ultimatum that if unions don't except the current offer by Wednesday they will revert to their original 8% for the first years and 8.5% for the second year. Spokesperson Zanele Sabela said: “Then on Thursday they reverted back to an earlier proposal which was 8% for the first year and 8.5% for the second year. So, it’s really getting ugly and now we are on to ultimatum.”
