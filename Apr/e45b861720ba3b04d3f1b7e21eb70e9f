Residents in Mahikeng say that Premier Supra Mahumapelo should not hide behind allegations of a plot to kill him and step down immediately. JOHANNESBURG - Residents of Mahikeng are calling on Premier Supra Mahumapelo to stop making excuses and step down immediately. Mahumapelo, who’s facing allegations of fraud and corruption, has revealed claims of a plot to kill him. He has also accused some within the African National Congress (ANC) of wanting to remove those who supported Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma ahead of the party’s elective conference in 2017. But residents say his time is up and that Mahumapelo should not hide behind allegations of a plot to kill him; instead they want him to step down immediately.  In December 2017, the embattled North West premier claimed that he had information of an alleged plot to kill him and his family. But this Mahikeng resident says Mahumapelo should stop hiding behind such allegations. “We won’t kill him… we’ll kill him because he doesn’t want to step down (sic).”  Protesting residents have called for Mahumapelo to resign or be removed from office amid the allegations of corruption against him. At the same time, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected in the province to address the growing unrest.
