The complaint was laid by his ex-girlfriend and musician Busisiwe ‘Cici’ Twala. JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it’s investigating a complaint against the prosecutor involved in kwaito star Arthur Mafokate’s case. Mafokate appeared in the Midrand magistrates court on assault charges on Wednesday. The complaint was laid by his ex-girlfriend and musician Busisiwe ‘Cici’ Twala. Mafokate’s case was postponed after the prosecutor recused himself because Twala laid a complaint against him with the NPA. The NPA’s Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane says: “We [NPA] can confirm that we received a complaint on 16 April with certain allegations made against the prosecutor.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
