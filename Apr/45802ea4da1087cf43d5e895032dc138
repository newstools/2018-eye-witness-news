Dintwe says that Fraser's decision was taken to frustrate his investigation. He adds that Fraser’s removal from the State Security Agency will not bring an end to his investigation, which he says will continue. Letsatsi-Duba and acting Director-General Loyisa Jafta have committed to providing Dintwe with all classified material that he needs to perform his duties. The Democratic Alliance has welcomed Letsatsi-Duba's intervention, saying that it is crucial for the minister and the acting director-general to co-operate with the Inspector-General.
