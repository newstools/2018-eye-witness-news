JOHANNESBURG - The hearse carrying the body of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has arrived at her home. Madikizela-Mandela’s family have left her Soweto home with political leaders to collect the struggle icon’s body. The procession made its way from the Kupane Funeral Parlour back to her house, while people lined the streets in a guard of honour. Thousands of mourners lined the roads around the freedom fighter's home ahead of her final return. The country is observing 10 days of mourning leading up to the struggle icon's official funeral at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Extraordinary scenes are unfolding with mourners singing struggle songs, uMkhonto weSizwe members carrying African National Congress flags and many young children also running amongst the crowd. People say it’s an amazing thing that the woman affectionately known as the mother of the nation lived with them in the township of Soweto. They say she was accessible and one with them. Others say she had every right to move elsewhere but chose not to. One of the struggle songs being sung is "Mma Winnie re fe matla", meaning "mother Winnie give us strength".
