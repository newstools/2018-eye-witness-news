PRETORIA - Performers at the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela  tribute concert in Pretoria said they are honoured to be remembering a people’s heroine. The concert which took place at the State Theatre boasted a line-up of legendary artists including Sibongile Khumalo  and Rebecca Malope. Khumalo says she remembers her childhood in Soweto and the prominent part Madikizela-Mandela played in it. “As a child growing up in Orlando west, we knew, I knew of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela the powerful, strong, forceful woman that she was.” Khumalo is one of the legends who performed on Friday after Malope and Oliver Mtukudzi brought the crowds to tears with their performances of radio classics Neria and Uyingcwele. The concert took place as Madikizela-Mandela’s body was expected to arrive at her Soweto home on Friday evening.
