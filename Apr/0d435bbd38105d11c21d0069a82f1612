Police and customs officers in uniform went on to the plane, spent several minutes inside and then disembarked. Only two pilots wheeling small black suitcases could be seen getting off the jet. There was no sign of the Gupta brothers. The company that owns the aircraft, Stoneriver, and export Development Canada, which financed the plane, went to court to have it returned to them.
