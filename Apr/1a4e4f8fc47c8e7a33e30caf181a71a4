Mmusi Maimane visited several townships around Mahikeng and re-assured residents that his party would work to remove Supra Mahumapelo MAHIKENG - Some residents of Mahikeng continue mopping up after a week of protests, Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called for calm. Maimane visited several townships surrounding Mahikeng where he re-assured residents that his party would do everything possible to remove Premier Supra Mahumapelo from office should the African national Congress (ANC) fail to do so. He says there is a need for a clean and corrupt free government and has called on the ANC to not make a political decision by retaining Mahumapelo, saying that will be a betrayal to the people of the North West. Maimane says residents also have a voice and has urged them to vote differently in next yearâ€™s general elections. He says a corrupt free government is the only way the North West can have proper service delivery. The DA leader says he understands that a woman lost her baby while attempting to give birth unattended. He blames this on the ANC-led government.
