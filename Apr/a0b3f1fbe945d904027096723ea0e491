The South African Jewish Board of Deputies says it’s unfair for the party to confront the artist whose music could be used to bridge the rifts among enemies. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) says the statement by the African National Congress (ANC) on Black Coffee's recent visit to Israel is unfortunate, especially in the week that the country mourns the death of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The deejay, whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo, has come under fire for defending his performance in Tel Aviv over the Easter weekend, with the ANC reiterating its call for a cultural boycott of Israel as a result. SAJBD vice president Zev Krengel says it’s unfair for the party to confront the artist whose music could be used to bridge the rifts among enemies. “We were very disappointed in the ANC, especially in a week where we’ve lost the Mother of the Nation. Black Coffee is one of the children of the nation and he could be used in so many good ways.” The SAJBD says it’s unlike the ANC to take the stance it has by calling for a cultural boycott on Israel without engaging the state. In a statement released on Wednesday, the ANC's Lindiwe Zulu says a boycott of Israel is critical in ensuring the country's apartheid government is isolated and she's called on local artists to rally behind the cause. While party says its waiting to engage Black Coffee, Krengel says the ANC has taken a hard-line stance on Israel and is being unfair. “What really gets to me is that in every other conflict, whether it’s with Zimbabwe or how we engage Syria, the ANC’s way of making peace has always been engaging always with all parties, but somehow when it comes to Jewish state, there’s a villain and there’s a victim and it is so un-ANC.”
