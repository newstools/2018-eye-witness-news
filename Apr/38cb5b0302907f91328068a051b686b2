JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Johannesburg has sentenced a 29-year-old woman to life behind bars for protecting the man who raped her two-month-old daughter.

It’s been reported that the mother maintained her child sustained the injuries from a fall. The woman's lawyers have indicated an intent to appeal both the conviction and the sentence.
