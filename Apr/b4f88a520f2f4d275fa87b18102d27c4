Cosatu secretary-general Bheki Ntshalintshali says he believes that if Chris Hani was alive, he would talk about the challenges he faced as the leader of the communist party. JOHANNESBURG - Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) secretary-general Bheki Ntshalintshali says he’s concerned about current leaders who want to leave when the going gets tough. He was speaking in Boksburg at a commemoration service for Chris Hani. Ntshalintshali says he believes that if Hani was alive, he would talk about the challenges he faced as the leader of the communist party.  Ntshalintshali had much to say about the importance of current leaders of various organisations remaining loyal and not turning away when matters become difficult. “Your organisation has not deserted you for some time… for wrong reasons you’ve not been under fire in that organisation.” He says the road ahead is tough, with millions of people who remain unemployed.  Ntshalintshali jokingly added that while South African Communist Party general-secretary Blade Nzimande is now Minister of Transport, he can work effectively on both portfolios. “We’ll march on Friday, not as his (Nzimande) enemy but to remind him we don’t want e-tolls.” The Springs Art Gallery will be open on Tuesday evening to the public where a photographic exhibition in honour of the late Chris Hani will be available for viewing.
