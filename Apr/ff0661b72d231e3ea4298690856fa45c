JOHANNESBURG - EWN is this afternoon distancing itself from a fake article circulating on WhatsApp with the headline “We were paid to organise protests against Supra”. This story, with the byline 'EWN Reporter' is NOT an EWN story and does not appear on our website or any of EWN's official social media platforms. Furthermore, all our articles will have a reporter's byline or indicate which staff member edited it and would not merely say 'EWN Reporter'. (Edited by Janice Healing)
