Alastair Cook was on four and Mark Stoneman two as the visitors moved to seven without loss in their second innings after facing five overs. CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand - England extended their lead over New Zealand to 36 runs in the second test at lunch on the third day at Hagley Oval after bowling out the hosts for 278 during the first session on Sunday. Alastair Cook was on four and Mark Stoneman two as the visitors moved to seven without loss in their second innings after facing five overs. Stuart Broad had earlier completed his 16th five-wicket haul, finishing with six for 54, while his new ball partner James Anderson had four for 76. New Zealand added 86 runs to their overnight score of 192 for six. Wicketkeeper BJ Watling top-scored with 85 before he was bowled by Anderson, while Tim Southee scored his fourth test half century before he was bowled by the 35-year-old for 50. Neil Wagner (24 not out) and Trent Boult (16) then provided a swashbuckling 10th-wicket partnership of 39 runs to get their side within sight of England’s first innings of 307. Watling and Southee attacked during the first five overs of the day, the last ones with the old ball, scoring an additional 27 runs before England took the second new ball. England then got the new ball to swing and seam, with Anderson’s delivery to dismiss Watling swinging in, pitching on middle and then seaming into the off stump. Broad had Ish Sodhi caught behind by Johnny Bairstow for one to achieve his five-wicket haul and gave the wicketkeeper his fifth catch of the innings. Southee fell two balls after reaching 50, before Wagner and Boult frustrated England’s bowlers and chipped away at the deficit. England need a win to stop New Zealand clinching their first series against them since 1999. The hosts won the first test at Eden Park in Auckland by an innings and 49 runs.
