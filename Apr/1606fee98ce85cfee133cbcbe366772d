Cosatu and SACP will tell President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC’s top officials to recall Supra Mahumapelo if they want the situation in Mahikeng to return to normal. JOHANNESBURG - A showdown is expected during a meeting between the African National Congress (ANC) and its alliance partners in the North West on Friday as the fate of Premier Supra Mahumapelo is decided. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) will tell ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa and the party’s top officials to recall Mahumapelo if they want the situation in Mahikeng to return to normal. The town has seen three days of violent protests in which a man died, properties torched, and shops looted as residents call for Mahumapelo’s head. Ramaphosa’s decision to cut his international trip short to attend to the situation in Mahikeng is crucial but even more crucial will be the party’s decision regarding Mahumapelo.  The SACP’s Madoda Sambatha says the communist party will push for Mahumapelo’s ouster at Friday’s meeting. “On the basis of what we see as the community, the premier must step down.” Cosatu’s Job Dliso also agrees says: “As Cosatu, we’ve raised the issue of corruption, and we maintain our stand.” The provincial ANC, on the other hand, has told Eyewitness News it will go into that meeting with a mandate to protect and defend the North West premier.
