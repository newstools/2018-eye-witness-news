Some 10,000 people - including residents, hospital patients and office workers - were evacuated from 9 am from buildings within an 800-metre radius of the bomb while experts performed the delicate operation. Police posted a video on Twitter showing officers walking up the stairs in an apartment building with the caption: “We’re not bringing room service or breakfast in bed but a personal wake-up call.” The gave the all the clear in the early afternoon and the city began getting back to normal. Long-distance and local train transport at the central station was disrupted for several hours but police said on Twitter that the station had now re-opened. Bus and tram services also restarted. The evacuation area included the Natural History Museum, the BND intelligence agency, a clinic of the Charite hospital and an army hospital. Some roads were closed but were due to gradually reopen.

Last year some 60,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Frankfurt after a massive bomb dropped by Britain’s Royal Air Force was unearthed.
