It’s understood a man was shot several times earlier on Wednesday evening in what appears to have been a hit. JOHANNESBURG - The M1 Highway has been closed to traffic in the northerly direction after a shooting near the Glenhove offramp. It’s understood a man was shot several times earlier on Wednesday evening in what appears to have been a hit. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department’s Wayne Minnaar says the victim died at the scene. “And motorists are now being diverted off at Glenhove offramp. Motorists can exit on 11th Avenue or Oxford Road offramps and take Oxford Road to Corlett Drive to join the M1 as officers have now blocked off the crime scene.” A woman who saw the shooting said: “When they went to the car they were walking because they couldn’t get on the other side of the freeway so they walked to it because the traffic on our side, the M1 north, was gridlocked so you could do whatever you wanted to do to whatever car but they went straight to that car, ignoring all the other cars.” At the same time, a man has been found dead in his car on the M2 highway near the Denver offramp. Police say they arrived on the scene to find the man with a gunshot wound in his bakkie which was parked on the side of the road. The motive behind this shooting is not yet known. The police's Mavela Masondo said: “We are appealing to anyone who’s got information that can help us during our investigation to please contact the nearest police station or call our crime stop number.”
