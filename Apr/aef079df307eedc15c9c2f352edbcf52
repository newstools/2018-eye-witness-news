The party's shadow Sports Minister Tsepo Mhlongo says: “PSL must provide concrete plans on intervention that they will implement to stop this violence at football matches. “And it’s unacceptable for families and spectators of sports that they've regularly been threatened by this bad behaviour and we call upon the PSL to account to Parliament.” Coach Steve Komphela announced his resignation shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, SuperSport is now assessing the damage to its equipment. Spokesperson Clinton van der Berg says: “We’re busy assessing the damage to our equipment which is substantial and we agree with a strong stance which the PSL has adopted.
