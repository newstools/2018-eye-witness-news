Scotlandâ€™s Marc Austin claimed the bronze. South Africa's Richard Murray finished sixth, ahead of Olympic silver medallist Jonathan Brownlee. The other South African in the event, Wian Sullwald, finished in 20th place. Team South Africa joins Bermuda and Malaysia in joint first on the medal standings with one gold each.
