CAPE TOWN - Fifty schools in the Western Cape are doing their part to save water as the province continues to battle a severe drought. Dettol is sponsoring the installation and maintenance of water meters at these schools, contributing to the #SmartWaterMeterChallenge. The initiative has already saved around 40 million litres of water. On 13 April, a water meter was installed at a Bellville primary school. The National Health Laboratory’s Susan Louw said: “Schools are a source of huge water consumption and often water wastage.
