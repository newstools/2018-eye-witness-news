Robben Island prisoners, who spent time with former president Nelson Mandela in jail, visited her family in Soweto on Wednesday to convey condolences to the family. Mpho Masemola, from the Political Prisoners Association, recalled a time when Madikizela-Mandela visited Mandela in prison. "She was very courageous especially in those cold cells of Robben Island. I remember there was a lot of jubilation among the prisoners when she came to visit Tata." He says more should be done to honour her.
