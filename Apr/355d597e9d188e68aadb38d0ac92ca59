According to a report, there is a detailed plan to undermine President Cyril Ramaphosa, which would see Sihle Zikalala re-elected as chairperson of KwaZulu-Natal. JOHANNESBURG - Supporters of former President Jacob Zuma in KwaZulu-Natal are reportedly plotting a campaign to oust President Cyril Ramaphosa as leader of the African National Congress (ANC). The Sunday Times is reporting that Zuma loyalists are planning to undermine Ramaphosa ahead of 2019’s elections, and ultimately have him removed. The paper also says the group has plans to split their votes by voting for the ANC in the province but giving their national ballots to another party. According to the Sunday Times, Zuma loyalists in KZN have a detailed plan to undermine Ramaphosa, which would see Sihle Zikalala, an ally to Zuma, re-elected as chairperson of the province, all in efforts to call for an early national general council followed by a national elective conference to remove Ramaphosa. If this fails, the group will then reportedly resolve to split their votes in the election in 2019 by voting with the ANC in the province but giving their national votes to a party sympathetic to their cause. At the same time, Apostle Caesar Nongqungaa, a close ally of Zuma, has formed a political party, apparently with Zuma's blessing. The Sunday Times also claims that Zuma backers were considering working with Andile Mngxitama’s Black First Land First (BLF) ahead of the elections in a bid to punish Ramaphosa for Zuma’s exit, however BLF leader has denied this.
