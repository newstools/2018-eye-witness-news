Tens of thousands of commuters across the country will have to continue making use of alternative forms of transport.

Tens of thousands of commuters across the country will have to continue making use of alternative forms of transport. Employers are offering a 9% wage increase from next month until March 2019, and an 8% hike the following year. But unions are not willing to accept this offer.

But from where we sit and with the employers negotiating in bad faith it is not really helpful.”
