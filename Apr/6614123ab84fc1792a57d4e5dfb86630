CAPE TOWN – Mayor Patricia de Lille is expected to meet with Vrygrond residents on Wednesday. Some locals have been protesting since Monday after they were evicted from a piece of land they'd been occupying illegally. Two shops at the nearby Capricorn shopping centre were looted, a car was torched and a vehicle on the nearby M5 highway was stoned during the demonstrations. On Tuesday, protesting community members demanded a meeting with De Lille to discuss their grievances. De Lille’s spokesperson Xolani Koyana says: “The mayor is clear that the meeting cannot go ahead while people continue to illegally occupy land and affect the lives of other residents by blocking roads.” WATCH: Councillor asks for ceasefire in Vrygrond ahead of meeting with mayor  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
