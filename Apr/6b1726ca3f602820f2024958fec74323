Former African National Congress Member of Parliament Jennifer Ferguson opened a case of rape against Jordaan last month, claiming the CEO raped her in 2014. JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Social Development Men's Forum has condemned the South African Football Association (Safa)'s reaction to calls for rape-accused Danny Jordaan to step down. In a statement, Safa spokesperson Dominic Chimhavi says the One Million Man March is just a lobby group using a big organisation such as Safa to gain legitimacy by calling for Jordaan's resignation. Former African National Congress Member of Parliament Jennifer Ferguson  opened a case of rape against Jordaan last month, claiming the CEO raped her in 2014. Last week Safa announced it will be standing by Jordaan. Men's Forum spokesperson Bongani Ngomane said: “We are reiterating the call by One Million Men March that Danny Jordaan must step down and Safa must apologise for that statement to the public.”
