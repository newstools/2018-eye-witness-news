The national carrier has been experiencing financial and operational issues for the past few years, recording a loss of almost R4 billion last year. Solidarity says SAA's current models have proved to be ineffective and as a result, unsustainable.

Which is why we have launched a business rescue application in order to prevent the inevitable liquidation that the Auditor General refers to with regards to their growing concern status.”
