JOHANNESBURG - Comedian and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah launched his own foundation on Wednesday afternoon in Johannesburg. The foundation focuses on helping orphans empower themselves with educational programmes, skills development and drug prevention. The youths will also be provided with means to allow them to pursue studies beyond high school graduation. The school aims to be sustainable in the long term with many projects being planned for the future for the comedian and the foundation. The foundation, which has partnered with computer giants Microsoft to help children, aims for children to be taught by good teachers; but for those lessons to be complemented by an adequate technological education system. The foundation will also focus on career guidance for young adults.
