The former president is facing charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering. DURBAN - Former president Jacob Zuma's corruption case has been provisionally adjourned to 8 June. The matter was heard in less than half an hour in the Durban High Court on Friday morning. Zuma is facing 16 charges stemming from the arms deal almost a decade ago. The charges against him were dropped in 2009, however, National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams announced last month that they would prosecute the former president. State prosecutor Billy Downer explained why they want a postponement. "The purpose of the adjournment is two-fold. Firstly, in respect of accused number one, Mr Zuma, we've been informed by our learned friends for Mr Zuma the he wishes to bring a review application on the decision to prosecute him again and in that respect we've been informed that they hope to finalise the review papers by the middle of May."
