Seipone Kwadipe shed a tear as she described how she was worried about her equipment when she heard that protestors looted and torched the Mmabana Arts Centre.   "I got a call from one of my cast members to say the building is in ashes." Kwadipe says that she understands the plight of the community but sheâ€™s hurt by the violence that affects her and the youth of Mahikeng. "This thing of protests against Supra, it really got to us now... where are we going?" The situation is calm now ahead of President Ramaphosa's arrival in the area around midday. But residents remain adamant that they want Mahumapelo gone.
