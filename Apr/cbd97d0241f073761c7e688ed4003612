The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) says workers have to stand together to challenge what they are calling a poverty wage. CAPE TOWN - Thousands of workers across the country plan to take to the streets later this month, in a protest against proposed amendments to the country’s labour laws. This includes the planned introduction of a national minimum wage, which has been postponed from its original 1 May implementation date. The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) says workers have to stand together to challenge what they are calling a poverty wage. The unions say that a proposed R20 an hour wage will further entrench poverty. They are also opposed to changes to strike laws. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says that the proposed amendments will curtail workers’ rights to protest. Thousands of union members are expected to take to the streets next Wednesday. “It will culminate with a mega strike on 25 April which is a protected national general strike under section 77 under the labour law.” Meanwhile, Parliament’s labour portfolio committee will meet this week to discuss public input on a national minimum wage.
