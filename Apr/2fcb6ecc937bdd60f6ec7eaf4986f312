Premier Soccer League chairperson Irvin Khoza has apologised for the chaos that marred a game between Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. CAPE TOWN - Premier Soccer League (PSL) chairperson Irvin Khoza says police need more assistance at football matches. “We’d have to assist them because sometimes they are overstretched, overworked and that’s why we don’t want this to be a problem of the law. When there’s a commission of inquiry there’s no sentiment, it’s either you comply or not.” Khoza on Monday apologised for the chaos that marred a game between Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Kaizer Chiefs fans stormed the field, attacked security staff and vandalised stadium property.
