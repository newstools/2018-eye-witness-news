JOHANNESBURG - An Indian man who has been missing for 40 years will soon be reunited with his family after a YouTube video of him singing a popular Hindi film song went viral. Khomdram Gambhir Singh was 26 when he left his home in Imphal in 1978 and never returned. For four decades, his family heard nothing. Then a clip showing a grey-bearded man singing a Bollywood song on a Mumbai street more than 3,000 kilometres away appeared online. Singh's family recognised him as their missing relative and contacted Imphal police who managed to track him down.
