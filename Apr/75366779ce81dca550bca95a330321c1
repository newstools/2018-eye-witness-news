JOHANNESBURG – South African DJ Black Coffee has joined millions of music fans and world-class DJs in paying tribute to the late Avicii. The Swedish DJ, whose real name is Tim Bergling, was found dead on Friday in Oman and no cause of death has been announced yet. In an emotional tweet, Black Coffee – born Nkosinathi Maphumulo – says he wanted to work Avicii.  The 28-year-old DJ retired from the music in 2016, citing health problems including acute pancreatitis, allegedly as a result of excessive drinking. However, Avicii was nominated for a Billboard music award this week as he never fully stopped making music.  Some of his most famous songs are Wake Me Up and Levels; he also recently worked with Rita Ora on Lonely Together.
