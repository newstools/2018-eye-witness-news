Representatives for the White House and 10 Downing Street said Trump would visit the United Kingdom on 13 July and hold bilateral talks with May but gave no other details. WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump will travel to Britain in July for a working visit with Prime Minister Theresa May, after months of back-and-forth over when the US president would visit what traditionally has been the United Statesâ€™ closest ally. Representatives for the White House and 10 Downing Street said Trump would visit the United Kingdom on 13 July and hold bilateral talks with May but gave no other details. It was also not immediately clear how long Trump would stay on his visit, which would come more than a year after taking office. The delay has raised questions about the US-UK relationship, and the working visit signals a more low-key affair than an official state visit. Trump had planned a trip to London to open a new US embassy there but cancelled in January. Many Britons have vowed to stage protests if Trump visits.
