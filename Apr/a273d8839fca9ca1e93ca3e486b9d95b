Correspondence attached to a court application reveals the Reserve Bank sent a request for documentation to Gupta-owned Tegeta resources at the end of last month. PRETORIA - Itâ€™s emerged the Reserve Bank  is investigating the sale of Gupta-owned Tegeta  resources shares to a little-known offshore company called Charles King SA. The details are contained in an interdict application filed by business rescue practitioners who claim Gupta-owned companies have prevented access to their business premises. Oakbay Resources announced it was selling its mining interests, which included the Optimum and Koornfontein Mines to the Swiss-registered company in August last year. Offshore company records revealed Charles King SA was registered as trading in fashion products and clothing. Correspondence attached to a court application reveals the Reserve Bank sent a request for documentation to Gupta-owned Tegeta resources at the end of last month. The central bank is particularly interested in reports that Tegeta has received an initial payment of R66 million from Swiss-based Charles King SA. The bank refers the company to legislation which states that no person may, without permission from Treasury, sell shares to a foreign entity. The Reserve Bank has asked Tegeta to provide a copy of the sales agreement as well as details relating to the R66 million payment.
