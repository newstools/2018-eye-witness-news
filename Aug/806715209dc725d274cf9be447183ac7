At least three busses were torched earlier on Monday. CAPE TOWN - MyCiti bus services to Khayelitsha remain suspended until further notice. At least three buses were torched  earlier on Monday. The city's Brett Herron said: “The city has this morning suspended the MyCiti services in Khayelitsha after three MyCiti buses were stoned and two Golden Arrow buses were set alight and the services will remain suspended until further notice.” The Golden Arrow Bus Service won't be operating in three areas in Cape Town following arson attacks. On Monday morning two buses were set alight in Khayelitsha and there have been reports of intimidation amid a taxi strike. Now the company says it will only restore services in Nyanga, Khayelitsha, and Delft when it's safe to do so. Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town has warned regular taxi commuters to make use of alternative transport as the taxi strike is set to continue. The Minibus Taxi Industry Task Team, which represents provincial taxi organisations like Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) and Congress for Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta), and commutes about 70% of taxi passengers in the province, embarked on a strike on Monday. It's demanding the national taxi umbrella body, South African National Taxi Council (Santaco), allows a provincial elective conference ahead of a national conference on 14 August. But Santaco has suggested a court order blocks it from doing so. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
