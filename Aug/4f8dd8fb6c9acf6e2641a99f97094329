Trollip was on Monday ejected from the job through a motion of no confidence vote tabled by the Economic Freedom Fighters. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) will challenge the removal of Athol Trollip as Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor in the courts. Trollip was on Monday ejected from the job through a motion of no confidence vote tabled by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). It was backed by a coalition of the African National Congress (ANC) and smaller parties. Sixty-one councillors remained in the Nelson Mandela Bay city council chamber after the DA, African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and Congress of the People (COPE) councillors abandoned proceedings on Monday following speaker Jonathan Lawackâ€™s removal. The council meeting went ahead though during which ANC councillor Buyelwa Mafaya was elected as the speaker to oversee proceedings. But DA leader Mmusi Maimane says this was unconstitutional. He adds the election of Mongameli Bobani as mayor undermines the electorate. Meanwhile, Bobani on Monday said he was unfazed by threats of a legal challenge.
