The new channel is 100% black-owned and 50% female-owned. JOHANNESBURG - MultiChoice has announced Newzroom Afrika as the new channel to replace Afro WorldView. CEO of MultiChoice Calvo Mawela made the announcement on Tuesday morning, weeks after Afro Worldviewâ€™s Mzwanele Manyi told workers not to report to work the next day. "I am pleased to announce, ladies and gentlemen, that the successful bidder is Newzroom Afrika." Mawela says they were looking for a channel that would cater for the needs of the South African viewer while advancing media in the country. The bidding process was kept confidential and Mawela says they intend to keep it this way by not revealing too much detail. Reports say that some unsuccessful bidders raised objections. Mawela says he is not aware of this. The new channel is 100% black-owned and 50% female-owned. Newzroom Afrika says their priority is to promote local channels.
