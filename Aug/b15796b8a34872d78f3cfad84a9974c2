Dessie Rechner, from the pink ladies, which is an organisation assisting police to find missing people, has urged the community to come forward with information. “The circumstances are that he was last seen in Bishop Lavis on the 25th [of July] at 05:30 in the morning when he left for work. He was driving a Ford Bantam bakkie but he never arrived at work at Tygerberg Hospital. He was last seen wearing his overalls and a black suit.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
