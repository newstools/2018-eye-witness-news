Former Steinhoff CFO Ben la Grange says that he's deeply saddened by the money that was lost in the company scandal that saw a 95% dive in share prices. CAPE TOWN - Steinhoff's former CFO Ben la Grange has told MP's that he did not deliberately do anything wrong. La Grange says that he's deeply saddened by the money that was lost in the company scandal that saw a 95% dive in share prices. MP's want to understand what went wrong at Steinhoff and whether anybody other than former CEO Markus Jooste has been referred to the Hawks for investigation. Earlier the firm's chairperson, Heather Sonn, was grilled, with MPs accusing her of feeding them recycled information. MPs want to know what went wrong at Steinhoff that led to the catastrophic collapse of its share price. But they felt they weren’t getting answers from Steinhoff chairperson Sonn. Finance committee chairperson Yunus Carrim said: "You're not helping and we're worried. You must give us legal arguments for why you won't answer specific questions. You must give us legal arguments why you give us names." Sonn insisted she was just trying to answer questions without jeopardising any criminal proceedings that might follow. “So please don’t see what I am doing here as an attempt to try and withhold anything.” So far, the only executive who is the focus of a criminal investigation is Jooste, who is the subject of a Hawks investigation.
