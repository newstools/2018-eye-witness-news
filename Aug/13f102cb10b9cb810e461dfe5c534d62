The acting chief executive at GCIS, Phumla Williams, is currently testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG - The acting chief executive at Government Communication and Information System (GCIS), Phumla Williams, has accused her predecessor Mzwanele Manyi of trying to influence of her testimony. Williams is currently testifying at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Parktown, Johannesburg, about the events that took place after Manyi took over as head of GCIS after Themba Maseko was sacked. Deputy Chief Justice Zondo has called on commission’s investigators to investigate the matter. Williams said: “Chairperson, I received a text message from Mr Manyi telling me to say that the TNA [New Age newspaper] breakfast didn’t happen, and it’s my view that he was trying to influence my submission.” Manyi has, on Friday, taken to Twitter to respond to Williams's claim, saying he was merely trying to clarify that the widely criticised New Age breakfast briefings happened after his tenure. At the same time, Zondo has warned against the intimidation of witnesses testifying at the inquiry. He says all witnesses who testify at the inquiry must feel safe. “If those who heed this call [to appear before the commission] are going to be intimidated or interfered with I think the commission needs to look into that very seriously.”  WATCH: Phumla Williams gives evidence at Zondo Commission  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
