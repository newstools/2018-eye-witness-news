LONDON - New Liverpool signing Fabinho is eager to make his Premier League debut but the Brazilian midfielder is aware that he must first adapt to the Merseyside club’s robust playing style under manager Juergen Klopp. Fabinho was an unused substitute in Liverpool’s 4-0 home win over West Ham United in their league opener, before the 24-year-old was left out of the squad for the 2-0 win at Crystal Palace and Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion. “As a new player I’m looking forward to knowing this league. Making my debut will be a positive thing as well,” the former Monaco player told the club’s matchday programme. “The Premier League has a lot of intensity and physicality. But I hope to adapt as soon as possible. I’ll give my all... my midfield partners have provided me with guidance and assistance. So have the defence.” Fabinho finds himself in a similar situation to left back Andy Robertson and midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who both had to spend time adapting to Liverpool’s formation and Klopp’s high pressing approach before breaking into the starting side. “I’m aware it’s a different playing style than Monaco. There were two in midfield there whereas here at Liverpool, there’s usually three,” Fabinho added. “Monaco had a transition similar to Liverpool’s. I think the two teams can be compared in this way. Both them have very fast transition, with every fast players up front. I hope to be as important here as I was at Monaco.” Liverpool will look to maintain their 100 percent record this season when they travel to Leicester City next weekend.
