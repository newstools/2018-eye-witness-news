Water cannon and more officers have been deployed to the venue after supporters marched through the town, saying that they want to protect their vote for Nelson Chamisa. A man says Emmerson Mnangagwa will not run the country. "Mnangagwa, this country cannot get anything from him. Only Chamisa. We are here to defend our votes, only our votes. We voted for Nelson Chamisa.” It was earlier reported on social media that the ZEC would announce presidential results on Wednesday afternoon.  Another man says he’s willing to die for his party. “If they are going to kill us, let them kill us. We are ready to die; this is our country… we want Nelson Chamisa as our president.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
