You have been our greatest source of inspiration and courage.” His brother, Sandile Mkhize, says that he promised ProKid that he would continue where he left off. “After I got a call, all I could do to tell Linda that I’ll take over from the visions he had, managing this as much as I can. I’m with Linda.” ProKid died last week in Johannesburg after a severe seizure.    (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
