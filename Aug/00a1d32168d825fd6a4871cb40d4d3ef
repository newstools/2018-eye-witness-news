The City of Cape Town says its various water projects are now all on track. CAPE TOWN - After months of delays, all three of Cape Town's desalination plants are up and running. The City of Cape Town says its various water projects are now all on track. The city is still in the midst of a drought. There’ve been many delays at the Monwabisi desalination because of a dispute between the city and the local community. Residents were demanding that more of them be employed at the facility. It was the last plant to be brought online. The city's Xanthea Limberg says that collectively the plants are producing eight million litres of water a day. “Monwabisi was the plant that came online later than the other two, but it is now complete and it is operating.” She adds that apart from desalination, authorities have also been looking at other sources of water. MORE DESALINATION PLANTS ON THE CARDS The city says it is looking at building permanent desalination plants in the metro. The Water and Sanitation Department says Capetonians still have a long way to go in managing the drought. There are currently three desalination plants in Strandfontein, V&A Waterfront, and Monwabisi. The plants are producing 8 million litres of potable water to the system. Limberg says having permanent desalination plants will assist with the drought. "Provisionally we have communicated that we were looking at either the Cape Town Harbour as one site and the Eskom power nuclear site as another option.” The Western Cape is still in the midst of a drought, the worse in a century. Cape Town dam levels are 56% full.
