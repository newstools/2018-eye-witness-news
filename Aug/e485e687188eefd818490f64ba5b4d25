Metro Police say three people have been arrested on charges of arson after the fire was extinguished. CAPE TOWN - Protesters have on Thursday started a fire on the roof of the OR Tambo Hall in Khayelitsha. Metro Police say three people have been arrested on charges of arson. The fire has been extinguished.  The protest has also resulted in the suspension of train services in the area. The Chris Hani line terminates at Philippi and Metrorail has advised commuters to use alternative transport. Japhta K Masemola Road is closed to traffic in both directions from Mew Way. The extent of fire damage to the OR Tambo Hall in Khayelitsha is yet to be determined. Mayco member JP Smith said: “It’s very disappointing indeed that the city infrastructure is targeted every time. This very hall was also damaged during protests in June this year and now once more, we’ll have to spend money on repairs that could have been used elsewhere in aiding community development.”
