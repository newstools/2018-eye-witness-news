They then broke into the cafeteria leaving it empty. Students could be seen walking around with items they took while law enforcement officials were nowhere to be seen. One student was seen carried by a group of young men after she apparently inhaled smoke from boxes which were set alight. Some were sitting on rocks theyâ€™ve placed on the nearby Aubrey Matlala Road. #TUTShooting Students are scared off from the Police station where they were gathered.
