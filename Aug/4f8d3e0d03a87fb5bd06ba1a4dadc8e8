This is a huge about-turn for the municipal entity which has suffered severe losses since 2013. CAPE TOWN - The Cango Caves outside Oudtshoorn has shown a profit of nearly R1 million over the 2017/2018 financial year. This is a huge about-turn for the municipal entity which has suffered severe losses since 2013. A progress report on the Cango Caves, handed to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, revealed the site suffered a loss of over R850,000 for the 2013/2014 fiscal year. During the following financial year, it registered losses of more than R2.9 million. The Democratic Alliance celebrates this as a victory since taking over governance of the Klein Karoo town from the African National Congress in 2016. The party’s Western Cape spokesperson Masizole Mnqasela says: “The report furthermore revealed that the caves recorded an increase in a number of international visitors, on our account the 60% of the total number of tourists in the area. Ultimately, the people of Oudtshoorn are the victors of the good news.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
