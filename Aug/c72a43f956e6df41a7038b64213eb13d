JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has reacted to the death of Zondeni Sobukwe, saying that her passing during Women’s Month is a sad loss, not only to her family but the nation at large.

Mama Sobukwe passed away in the Western Cape on Wednesday morning at the age of 91, following a long illness. Ramaphosa says that Sobukwe was a heroine of the resistance and a fighter for freedom. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko says: “Her sterling contribution was also recognised when she was bestowed with the National Order of Luthuli. The president has said that Mama Sobukwe’s passing is a loss to her family, a loss to her community, a loss to the PAC and indeed the country at large.” At the same time, Pan Africanist Congress of Azania’s Narius Moloto conveyed the party’s condolences to the Sobukwe family, urging South Africans to celebrate the liberation stalwart’s life.    ‘A HUMBLED WOMAN’ The late struggle veteran is being remembered as one of the most defiant and fearless icons of the struggle against racism and white supremacy in South Africa. Thando Sipuye, an executive member of the Afrocetrik Study Group at the University of Fort Hare, says Sobukwe dedicated her life to the cause of the people of South Africa. “A woman so humbled and compassionate, an ordinary citizen who sacrificed her life, sacrificed her family and suffered immensely for equal liberation that we celebrate today.”  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
