JOHANNESBURG – National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has signed a wage agreement with Eskom after several months of tough negotiations. The three-year agreement includes a 7.5% increase for the first year and a 7% increase for the following two years. The utility has also agreed to a once off R10,000 cash payment to employees in the bargaining forum.  Eskom initially said that it had no money for increases. Numsa's Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says: “We thank our members for demonstrating militant discipline in the face of extreme provocation by the employer. We started at zero percent but thanks to their efforts, we’ve secured an increase.”
