WELLINGTON - Crusaders coach Scott Robertson has been touted as a future All Blacks coach but the break-dancing avid surfer is happy to bide his time with the eight-times Super Rugby champions. Robertson, who leads his side into their second successive Super Rugby final against the Lions on Saturday, is contracted until the end of the 2019. Current All Blacks coach Steve Hansen is expected to step down after next year’s Rugby World Cup and some pundits in the rugby-mad country have suggested New Zealand Rugby should look at the former international loose forward as his replacement. The 43-year-old, however, said on Friday that he was keen on staying with the Crusaders when his contract comes up for renewal. “I’ve always wanted to stay here,” Robertson told the New Zealand Herald on Friday. “I love it. “There will be a review after the season is finished... and talks will start next year about hopefully how long they would like me for.” Robertson, who has lost just three games in his two-year tenure with the Crusaders, said he was in no hurry to coach the All Blacks. “It’s like anything in life. Opportunities come up and if the timing is right you look at them,” he said. “One thing I’ve learned is you have to be patient. Time is something that benefits you as a coach. “I’m definitely not in a rush. The more patient I’ve been probably the more settled it’s been for me.”
