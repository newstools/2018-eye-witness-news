The committee says land expropriation without compensation should be discussed thoroughly in Parliament before decisions are made. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) says the expropriation of land without compensation is not the party’s electioneering slogan, adding it should be discussed thoroughly in Parliament before decisions are made. The party’s NEC says it has discussed parliamentary processes in respect of expropriation, Women’s Month and a report on the national student fund. VBS Bank also featured in their discussions. ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte says that the national working committee (NWC) has welcomed Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize's intervention at VBS by instigating a criminal investigation into the bank’s operations. She says where wrongdoing is found, the law should take its course. “That the most vulnerable clients, that’s the poor, elderly and unemployed people, whose individual and collective savings through stokvels and burial societies, have been affected.” The NWC has also welcomed the latest value-added tax (VAT) panel report, which had recommended exemptions on necessities, including sanitary towels. The NWC and NEC have called on parliamentarians to apply their minds when considering the over one million submissions regarding land expropriation. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
