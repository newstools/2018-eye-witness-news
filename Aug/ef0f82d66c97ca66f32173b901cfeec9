Pupils at the Unity Secondary School have been left traumatised after witnessing the attack by angry residents. “From that day, things haven’t been well here at school… it’s so difficult for us to learn,” said one learner. Nkosi-Malobane said the boy was taken to this particular school because community members suspected his friends were involved in gang activities. “Some of the group ran to this school to start looking for those people. The boy was, unfortunately, attacked on his way to come and point out his friends.” Three people have been arrested in connection with the mob attack and police are looking for more suspects.
