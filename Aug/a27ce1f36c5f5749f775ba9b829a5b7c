So, it was obvious that we needed an event for Women’s Day.” Okuhle Nomadluka says she is excited: “I’m excited to go to New York because I’ve never been on a plane. I joined Ted-Ed Club because I knew that it would change my life.” Organisers say they’ve so far raised R25,000 and will need a total of R100,000 for the girls.
