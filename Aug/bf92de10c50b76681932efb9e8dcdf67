Residents are demanding the immediate deployment of security following a spate of burglaries and a recent shooting at a Khayelitsha high school. CAPE TOWN - A group of Khayelitsha residents has gathered in Keizergracht Street in the Cape Town's CBD to highlight a spike in attacks at schools in the area. Residents are demanding the immediate deployment of security following a spate of burglaries and a recent shooting at a Khayelitsha high school. They say gangs are holding learning facilities hostage. Leaders are handing over a memorandum to Western Cape Premier Helen Zille with a list of safety and security demands. The Khayelitsha Development Forum's Thandi Msuthu says most of the schools in the area are closed on Monday. “The purpose of this march is because of all of this… There are a lot of burglaries that have happened in Khayelitsha schools and there are teachers who have been robbed during the day on their way to work. Another teacher was shot in the arm… We don’t have the security.” WATCH: Khayelitsha residents stand up against crime  At the same time, the Western Cape Education Department says it's concerned following the closure of some schools in Khayelitsha on Monday. Department Spokesperson Bronagh Casey said: “While we wholeheartedly support the need for additional safety measures and police visibility, the prevention of teaching and learning time will only have negative consequences for the learners themselves. We support initiatives that promote teacher and learner safety but not at the detriment of learners and the delivery of the curriculum.” Community leaders have given Zille seven days to respond to their demands.
