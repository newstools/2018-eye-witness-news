JOHANNESBURG - The #TotalShutdown movement says will be releasing a petition calling on the convicted rapist and kwaito star Brickz to stop performing his music. The musician, whose real name is Sipho Ndlovu, performed on Friday at the Mzansi Kwaito and House Music Award ceremony. According to reports, Brickz owed the organisers a gig from back in 2016 which he could not fulfil because he was in prison. The musician is currently out on bail for raping his then 15-year-old orphaned niece in 2013. However, the movement's Zimasa Nqabeni's says it is shocking that the organisers allowed a convicted rapist to perform at their event. “They don’t see it as an important societal issue because you cannot have such a massive moment a couple of years ago and yet you’re not feeling some kind of empathy to say how can we make a difference.”
