The school has sent out a communique to parents, saying Catzavelos is not welcome until further notice. JOHANNESBURG - The private Johannesburg school where Adam Catzavelosâ€™ children are enrolled has banned the businessman from its premises in the wake of his racist video rant. The school, which Eyewitness News will not name to protect the minors involved, has sent out a communique to parents, saying Catzavelos is not welcome until further notice. Meanwhile, earlier on Wednesday, the Economic Freedom Fighters opened a criminal case against him after he used the k-world in a video while boasting on a Greek beach that not a single black person was in sight. His relatives have also fired him from the family business. WARNING: Video contains strong and offensive language  At the same time, the Federation of Hellenic Communities and Societies of South Africa has distanced itself from Catzavelo's comments, saying they in no way reflect that of the Hellenic community. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has also expressed its outrage. A number of food businesses have announced a boycott of the Catzavelos family's St George's Fine Foods after the racist video.    Meanwhile, the EFF has opened a criminal case against Catzavelos at the Bramley police station on Wednesday.
