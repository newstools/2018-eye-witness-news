Retired judge Nugent is investigating tax administration and governance since at Sars since 2014 under Tom Moyane’s leadership. PRETORIA – The South African Revenue Service (Sars) must re-establish its large business centre (LBC) to deal with inefficiencies affecting big corporate taxpayers, the Nugent Commission of Inquiry  has heard. The panel heard this week how the centre was dismantled when the new operating model was introduced, which created significant challenges in the ability to collect revenue from corporates. Retired judge Nugent is investigating tax administration and governance since at Sars since 2014 under Tom Moyane’s leadership. Sars relationship manager Anthony Cohen described how the new operating model fragmented their operations. “Sometimes we had staff sitting in Megawatt Park while their managers were sitting in Alberton. Me and my team now have to engage with everyone around the greater Johannesburg area to try and get things sorted which we could have walked down the passage for in the past.” Commissioner Michael Katz asked Narcizio Makwakwa, the LBC’s former manager, about a possible solution to the current situation. “Is it fair to say that the only way to resolve the problems of fragmentation is to have a structure which the old LBC represented?” Sars on Friday confirmed that it would re-establish its large business unit as well as the illicit economy team.
