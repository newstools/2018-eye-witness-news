The police earlier on Wednesday stated that a handmade bomb was found at the mosque, but they have since clarified this. JOHANNESBURG - A man has been arrested in Roshnee near Vereeniging on charges of possessing a hoax bomb. The thirty-six-year-old was arrested after he left a bag containing a hoax bomb in the mosque. The man left the bag in the mosque on Monday evening at around 6:30pm and was arrested on Tuesday when he returned to collect his bag. Despite messages on social media saying there was a bomb, the police's Fikile Funda says no explosives were found. â€œWe called in our bomb disposal unit and they confirmed it was not a bomb. It was flask wrapped in sellotape and it contained vaseline and an unidentified substance. It is not something that we can say constituted a bomb." The man will appear in court on Thursday morning on charges of carrying a hoax bomb.
