CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) members interested in becoming the city's next mayor will have until 3 September to submit their CVs. The party says it hopes to finalise the process of naming Patricia De Lille's successor by the end of next month, to allow for a seamless transition. De Lille agreed to step down two weeks ago when the DA said it would call off its disciplinary action against her after an almost year-long spat. The party officially opened the application and nomination process on Monday to find her successor after a two-day federal executive meeting over the weekend that came up with a timeline for the process. DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi explains: “There’ll be a screening committee that goes through all the applications and after that a selection panel will meet to interrogate and interview the candidates. They will come up with the number one candidate, who will be the proposed individual.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
