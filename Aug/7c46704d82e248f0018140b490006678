JOHANNESBURG - Sportspeople, fans and others around the world have come out in support of tennis superstar Serena Williams amid a ban of her "Black Panther" catsuit by the French Open. The 36-year-old American star stunned Paris this year in her body-hugging outfit which she said was inspired by the Black Panthersuperhero movie and made her feel like a "warrior princess". As well as describing it as "fun and functional", Williams insisted it helped her prevent a return of the blood clots which put her life in danger after giving birth last year. However, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) insist that the outfit or anything similarly eye-catching will not be welcome at Roland Garros in 2019. While Williams is yet to make a formal statement, there have been many messages of support for her on social media.
