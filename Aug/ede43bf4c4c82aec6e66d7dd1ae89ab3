JOHANNESBURG - The three-week long Gautrain strike has come to an end after the company reached an agreement with workers. Trade union federation Fedusa has confirmed that it has been given the mandate to sign for an 8% pay hike across the board.   The company has agreed to an entry wage of R8,500, including a R900 housing subsidy. The United National Transport Union (Untu) and Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) say they are pleased with the outcome, but still, accuse the employer of having negotiated in bad faith. The strike saw scores of commuters left stranded. Scores of workers at the Gautrain depot in Midrand have expressed their joy at the outcome. Fedusa secretary general Dennis George says the fight is not over yet and has vowed to approach the courts to force Gautrain to make its financial statements available. “We don’t know exactly how much profits are being made [and] what is the issues (sic)? And that is very critical and that’s the reason why we are prepared to take it to the Constitutional Court.” He says those who wish to go back to work on Monday may do so, but assured commuters that all Fedusa members will be back at work on Tuesday.
