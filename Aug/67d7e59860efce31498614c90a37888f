The DA’s Natasha Mazzone says: “We call on student leaders and varsity management to work on ending violence and preventing further loss of life. We need to ensure that there’s a proper investigation and those responsible for the cutting short the loss of life of a student are held accountable. We will be laying criminal charges at the Soshanguve SAPS.” The student was shot dead during student protests. Some students claimed the vote had been rigged. Students say that they’re scared of being victimised and they’ve accused campus security of failing to protect them. This shooting happened outside the same campus were Fees Must Fall leader Benjamin Phetlha was knocked down and killed by a car in 2016. ARRESTS TUT students at the Soshanguve campus are demanding the arrest of a police officer who allegedly shot and killed the student.
