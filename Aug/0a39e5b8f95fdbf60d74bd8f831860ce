Wits, champions two seasons ago only to finish 13th in defence of the title, have a maximum nine points from three matches. JOHANNESBURG - Wits went three points clear at the top of the South African Premiership Wednesday with a smash-and-grab 1-0 victory at Orlando Pirates. The lone goal came on 80 minutes in Soweto when Gladwin Shitolo deflected a Hashim Domingo shot past his goalkeeper at the near post. Wits, champions two seasons ago only to finish 13th in defence of the title, have a maximum nine points from three matches. Pirates dominated possession, but Shitolo suffered more bad luck having also conceded an own-goal on matchday one. The 'Buccaneers' slipped one place to sixth, five points adrift of Wits, whose squad underwent wholesale changes during the close season. "We had only about 20% possession, but I told my players to be patient and the chances will come," said Wits coach Gavin Hunt. "Domingo is a hidden gem, a fantastic footballer. I do not know why he has not played for Bafana Bafana (the South African national team)." Pirates' Serb coach Milutin Sredojevic said: "Accidents happen in football, but had we taken our scoring chances the own-goal would not have hurt us so much."
