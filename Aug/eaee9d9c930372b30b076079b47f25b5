The minister joined a site visit at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital following complaints of a lack of nurses. JOHANNESBURG - Public Service and Administration Minister Ayanda Dlodlo has acknowledged that the health, home affairs and police sectors are grossly understaffed. The minister joined a site visit at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital on Monday following complaints of a lack of nurses.  Ndlodo says nurses are under severe pressure to deliver quality healthcare due to skewed patient-nurse ratio. “But it's those that we’d like to thank and acknowledge you for because you’ve embraced those circumstances.” Ndlodo says out of the eight people she talked to in the maternity ward at the hospital, six were foreigners. “We should push the presidents of the continent to prioritise health care for women so that they don’t have to cross borders.” The minister has urged nurses to also take care of their own well-being and report any bad practices in the workplace. 'NO JOB CUTS' The minister also addressed reports on job cuts, assuring nurses that 30,000 jobs in the public sector are not at risk, as reported recently. “They will leave because there’s an offer on the table for early retirement. They will face no penalty for the employee-initiated severance package, where you come to us to say you want to exit earlier.” The Mail & Guardian quoted an ANC insider as saying there is a plan to cut jobs in the public sector. “There is no such thing as the retrenchment of 30,000 people in the public sector.” She has urged workers not to listen to the media, saying there are processes to follow for job cuts during which the unions will be involved.
