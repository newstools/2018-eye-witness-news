JOHANNESBURG - The families who were trapped in a burning Johannesburg building have now been brought to safety as firefighters work to extinguish the blaze. Firefighters managed to make their way to the top of the 10-story building to rescue those trapped, including at least two babies. It’s not yet clear what sparked the fire, but the City of Johannesburg says it broke out just two hours after a team inspected the hijacked premises. Women with babies on their back have been escorted out of the building to safety.  This woman who doesn’t want to be named spoke to Eyewitness News, with her baby still strapped to her back, describing how she feared for her life. “Yes, it’s very scary inside there. I don’t know what happened, I just saw the fire.” Another woman who also jumped to an adjacent building with her baby was too traumatised to speak. She has been reunited with her other daughter and the relieved family was seen kissing and hugging one another. ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION Joburg disaster management is arranging alternative accommodation for residents who lost their belongings in the fire. A man clutches a small fire extinguisher while sitting on the pavement outside the gutted building. He’s explained to EWN how he tried to save his shop and rescue other families during the blaze. “We tried to tell them to come out because the fire started in the corner.” The area is still cordoned off with people standing on the pavement, many are wondering where they’ll sleep on Thursday night.
