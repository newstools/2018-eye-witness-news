If the ANC vote of no confidence in Msimanga is entertained without the EFF, it won’t pass, unless some DA councillors vote with the party. PRETORIA - The speaker of the Tshwane Council has disallowed the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)'s motion of no confidence in Mayor Solly Msimanga, saying it doesn’t comply with the rules. The council started on Thursday morning but it's been dealing with other agendas. The EFF and African National Congress (ANC) were expected to support the motion and they have enough numbers for it to pass. But senior Democratic Alliance (DA) leaders have told Eyewitness News they have clinched a deal with other parties late on Wednesday night that will see Msimanga retain his position as mayor. The Speaker of the Tshwane Council Rachel Mathebe has ruled that the EFF's motion of no confidence into Msimanga will not be allowed, as the party did not motivate for urgency in writing, as required by the rules. She says the EFF merely submitted the urgent motion. The EFF then walked out of the council.  The leader of the EFF in the council Benjamin Disoloane says they won’t support the ANC motion. “We bring our motions here of no confidence on the executive mayor, and we are saying we call on everyone to support our motions but because our motion is falling out, we cannot sit in the council.” This means Msimanga will live another day as mayor because the ANC doesn’t have enough numbers to oust him. Msimanga did tell EWN on Thursday morning that he was sure that he will be mayor by Friday, suggesting there was a deal struck with the red berets.
