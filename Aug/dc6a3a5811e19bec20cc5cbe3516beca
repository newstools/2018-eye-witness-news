NEW YORK – Serena Williams was the highest paid female athlete for a third consecutive year in 2018, according to an annual list here published by Forbes on Tuesday that was dominated by tennis players.

Williams, who will try to equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles when she competes at the 27 August to 9 September US Open in New York, earned twice as much off the court as any other female athlete, according to Forbes.
