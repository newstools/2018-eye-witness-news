The win takes Pirates to third on the log on seven points from five games. JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates recorded their second win of the Absa Premiership season with a controversial 2-1 win over Black Leopards at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday night. The match was sent into controversy when Pirates striker Thamsanqa Gabuza walked off the playing field after putting in a cross which deflected off a Leopards defender Thivhavhudzi Ndou and into the back of the net before taking off his shirt and throwing it into the crowd and walking off the field. Gabuza subsequently was shown two yellow cards for taking off his shirt and leaving the pitch without permission from the match officials, forcing Pirates to play 55 minutes with 10 men on the park. Vincent Pule then netted his first goal for his new club but Joseph Mhlongo pulled one back for Lidododuvha. The win takes Pirates to third on the log on seven points from five games. Gabuza's walk-off is believed to have been sparked by fan criticism of his performances as well as a comment by former Banyana Banyana striker Portia Modise. Modise, in a radio interview earlier this month, said that she believed that she was better than Gabuza, saying that he could not trap the ball properly as he used his shin guards to do so. She then claimed that she could easily replace him in the Pirates side. Below is some social media reaction to Gabuza's walk-off.
