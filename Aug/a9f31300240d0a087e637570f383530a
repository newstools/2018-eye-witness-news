The police's Kay Makhubela says it’s still unclear at this stage what led to the murder, but an investigation is underway. “We have opened a case of murder and we’re calling on anyone with information about the man or the suspects to come forward.” Security was bolstered in the area last week amid threats of more violence after a mob of angry residents necklaced a pupil. He was rushed to hospital with serious injuries but another man was later beaten to death, also after being accused of being part of a gang.
