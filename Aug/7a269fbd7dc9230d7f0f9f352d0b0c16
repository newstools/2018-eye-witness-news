Andrew Plaatjies was arrested after the girl's decomposing body was discovered under a carpet in a wendy house, 11 days after her disappearance. CAPE TOWN - The man who murdered 13-year-old Rene Roman in Lavender Hill has been handed two life sentences. The trial was scheduled to get underway on Monday but it emerged the 51-year-old, who faced charges of rape and murder, had entered into a plea and sentencing agreement and on Monday Judge Robert Henney handed down the sentence. He was arrested after the girl's decomposing body was discovered under a carpet in a wendy house, 11 days after her disappearance. Her hands and feet were bound. The chairperson of the Rene Roman Search and Rescue Organisation Zaida Samuel said: “We prayed to him as the judge and he says this has to stop and that he will not tolerate men being cowards. He prepared Rene’s body to rape but when he realised she was dead, he did nothing.” Meanwhile, the Lavender Hill community believes justice has been served after the Western Cape High Court handed Plaatjies two life sentences. Lavender Hill community leader Lucinda Evans says relatives and community members sobbed as Judge Henney handed down the sentence. “He also cited that we teach our children about stranger-danger but some of these monsters are family, friends and uncles. He was a family friend, a very close family friend.” Evans says she's happy Roman will now find eternal rest.
