JOHANNESBURG - The chaotic scenes which have played out during the funeral of late anti-apartheid icon, Zondeni Sobukwe, have been widely condemned. Sobukwe died last week at her home after a long illness. Her funeral, which was proclaimed a special official funeral, is taking place in Graaf-Reinet in the Eastern Cape.  Deputy President David Mabuza was meant to deliver the eulogy at the funeral but was disrupted by members of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), the party founded by Sobukwe's late husband, Robert Sobukwe. Mabuza was whisked away by security officials. Members were also unhappy about the South African flag being draped on Mama Sobukwe's casket and demanded it be removed and replaced by the PAC flag. They were also not happy with Defense Minister Nosivie Mapisa-Nqakula being the funeral's MC. She too had to eventually leave.  Later, the service continued with her grandchild, Otua, delivering the obituary. The funeral has been reclassified as no longer a special official category two funeral due to the disruptions. Members of the public and politicians have condemned the disruptions.
