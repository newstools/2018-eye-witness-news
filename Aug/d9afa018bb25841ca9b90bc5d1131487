She described him as unremorseful for the vicious manner in which he attacked his victims. The schoolgirls were aged between 10 and 18 when they were kidnapped at knifepoint and then sexually assaulted. Hoya also robbed some of the girls. Savage says his punishment must reflect the seriousness with which both the court and society view the violent attacks. She says it must also send a clear message that such acts will be punished harshly, recognising the deep and horrific lifelong consequences for the victims. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
