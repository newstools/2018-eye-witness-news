Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi  has slammed those who are spreading false information to the media, saying some people are “hungry for glory.” “Because I have realised after Life Esidimeni there are lots of people who are hungry for glory. Who are clawing at everything to be famous on the back of Life Esidimeni because some did attain fame during that period. So, we don’t need something like that.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
