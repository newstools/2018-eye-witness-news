Kabul police spokesperson Hashmat Stanekzai said the attackers were firing rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons but it was unclear how many gunmen were involved. The area around the site was closed off but media reported that gunfire and at least one explosion could be heard. There was no initial word on any casualties or claim of responsibility.
