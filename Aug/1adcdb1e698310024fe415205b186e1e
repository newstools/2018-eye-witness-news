CAPE TOWN - The Knysna Animal Welfare Society is in need of cat and dog food donations as supplies are fast depleting. The non-profit organisation says a recent food donation ended up being contaminated and affected its entire food storing room. The society's Michelle Don said: “Being an NPO, we can’t financially afford to buy any food to assist our animals and we run a hospital clinic and our adoption centre, so obviously we’re in need.”
