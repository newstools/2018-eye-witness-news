JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President David Mabuza has described South Africa as a violent nation. Speaking at a prayer day event in Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium, Mabuza lamented the rate of murder of women and children in the country. He says violence perpetrated against women is an offence against the founding values of South Africa and its Constitution. Mabuza says such acts have no space in the quest for social cohesion. “A nation that will continue to undermine its own women and oppresses them, that nation will have no peace.”  (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
