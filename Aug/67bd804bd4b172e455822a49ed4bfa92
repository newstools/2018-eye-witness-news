Thousands of women and gender non-conforming people across the country are meeting to stage nationwide marches. At Curries Fountain, women are expected to start their march at the Durban City Hall where they’ll hand over a memorandum. Hundreds of women have begun gathering at Curries Fountain ahead of a historic march against gender-based violence and femicide. One of the women organising the KwaZulu-Natal leg of Wednesday’s #TotalShutDown march, Ncumisa Ndelu, says the show of unity is one of the biggest indicators that these issues should remain top of the agenda. “We have women from different political affirmations, women from different religious organisations and women from different NGOs. They stand for different things whenever they come from, but today they’re here wearing black and a touch of red like we asked them to.”  There are three marches planned across the province, with the one in Durban another in Pietermaritzburg and the third demonstration in Newcastle. Some of the prominent women joining Wednesday’s march include poet Gcina Mhlophe and KZN Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
