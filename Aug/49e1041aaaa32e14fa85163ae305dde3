JOHANNESBURG - Labour unions have announced their plan to initiate a march at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto tomorrow morning. This comes amid allegations of corruption levelled against the institution. Several unions are said to be part of the demonstration, which is set to take off at Vuyani Mabaxa Park. The unions say they plan to hand over a memorandum to the hospital's management, demanding the release of a report of an investigation into maladministration at the hospital.
