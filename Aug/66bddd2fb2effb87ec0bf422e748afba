The General Council of the Bar has also filed its application for leave to appeal the decision which set aside the ruling to strike the two from the role of advocates. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa  has announced that he intends to institute inquiries into the fitness to hold office of National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. The General Council of the Bar has also filed its application for leave to appeal the decision which set aside the ruling to strike the two from the role of advocates. It's arguing that the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) ignored critical evidence against the pair. The pair were criticised for their handling of the decision to withdraw criminal charges against former head of crime intelligence, Richard Mdluli. General Council of the Bar chairperson Craig Watt-Pringle says some of the findings by the majority in the SCA were not well-founded, while the minority reached a diametrically opposed conclusion. He says the case raises the important legal question of the standard of conduct to which advocates, including State advocates, should be held if they are to remain on the roll of advocates Watt-Pringle has described the SCA findings in relation to Jiba’s conduct in the Johan Booysen matter as being opaque. He added the court simply did not deal with the untruthfulness of the statements made by Jiba. It’s still not clear if Jiba and Mrwebi will remain on duty or return to being on special leave until the matter is finalised. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
