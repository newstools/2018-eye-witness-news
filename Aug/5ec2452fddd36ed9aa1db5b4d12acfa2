The court has ordered Sassa and its CEO Pearl Bhengu to cover the costs of an urgent application to extend the agency’s contract with Cash Paymaster Services. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it’s disappointed with Thursday’s Constitutional Court judgement which has exonerated former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini from paying South African Social Security Agency (Sassa)’s legal costs. The court has ordered Sassa and its CEO Pearl Bhengu to cover the costs of an urgent application to extend the agency's contract with Cash Paymaster Services. The pair will have to pay the costs in their official capacity. In March, the court was forced to extend the invalid contract for six months to ensure millions of beneficiaries were not affected. The agency argued that the Post Office would not have the capacity to fully administer the payment of social grants to millions of beneficiaries come April. The DA’s Gauteng shadow MEC for Social Development Refiloe Ntsekhe says Dlamini should have also been ordered to pay for Sassa’s legal court battles. “Quite frankly, she was negligent if you look at the debacle in the Social Development Department when she was still the minister.” Ntsekhe says Dlamini showed little regard for the poor. “She had no respect for the poor and the most vulnerable.” The party says it hopes the social grants crisis commission will hold Dlamini fully accountable for the social grants crisis. Ntsekhe said: “I think it should’ve extended to the minister [Dlamini] because when it comes to the responsibility and management of Sassa, the buck stops with her. And it’s a bit unfair that she’s been exonerated while the people she manages have not.”
