JOHANNESBURG - South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has ditched six of his original Rugby Championship squad for a second-round match against Argentina in Mendoza this Saturday. Out of the 35-man squad go backs Lwazi Mvovo, Jesse Kriel, and Ross Cronje and forwards Marvin Orie, Jean-Luc du Preez, and Sikhumbuzo Notshe. A seventh absentee is flanker Cyle Brink, who had knee surgery last week and will be out of action for an undisclosed period. The Springboks did not impress for much of a 34-21 victory  over the Pumas in Durban this weekend and Erasmus has promised "four or five changes" for the reverse fixture.
