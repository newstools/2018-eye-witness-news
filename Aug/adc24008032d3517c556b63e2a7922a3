MADRID – Spanish police said on Monday they had shot a man armed with a knife as he tried to attack a police station in the northeastern region of Catalonia. Regional Mossos police said on Twitter the man had entered the police station in Cornella, near Barcelona, just before 0400 GMT “with the aim of attacking the officers” adding he had then been shot. A Mossos spokeswoman said she could not give any further information.
