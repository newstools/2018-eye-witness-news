NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku has declined to comment on the matter, saying the organisation doesn’t comment on employment-related issues. JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s Glynnis Breytenbach has welcomed reports that former prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams has resigned from the National Prosecuting Authority. While News24 is reporting that the advocate took a retirement package, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku has declined to comment on the matter, saying the organisation doesn’t comment on employment-related issues. Earlier in August, the Constitutional Court set aside Abrahams appointment as the National Director of Public prosecution, he then went on leave. Breytenbach, who is a former prosecutor, says it’s a good thing the NPA appears to be rid of Abrahams. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
