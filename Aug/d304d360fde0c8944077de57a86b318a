The Commission for Gender Equality has called for punitive measures against political parties who don't adhere to the 50/50 gender parity. CAPE TOWN - A number of organisations representing the interests of women have gathered in Parliament on Monday for a Women’s Charter Review Conference. The conference serves as a launch pad to engage women across all sectors of society on issues like gender-based violence and gender parity.  The Commission for Gender Equality has called for punitive measures against political parties who don't adhere to the 50/50 gender parity. The commission's Nomsisi Bata says this will ensure that parties don't pay lip service to advance women representation. “We will not rest until 50/50 representation is legislated and punitive measures apply to political parties who do not adhere to this.”  NCOP deputy chairperson Raseriti Tau says men and boys should play a greater role in advancing women’s rights. “The engagement of men and boys is invaluable and incalculable in advancing women’s rights.” The conference will culminate in the adoption of a Women’s Charter which will take place in March next year.
