Speaking on the Karima Brown Show, Molefe says that the officials will be given an opportunity to motivate why they shouldn't be suspended. "We live in a constitutional democracy where we believe in the rule of law and I think it is required that when you are going to suspend a person then give them the opportunity to be heard, you want to give the opportunity to tell us why we should not proceed to suspend them."
