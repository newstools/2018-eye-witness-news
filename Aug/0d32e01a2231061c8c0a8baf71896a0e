Former government spokesperson Themba Maseko has also referred to a statement signed by former director generals calling for a state capture inquiry. JOHANNESBURG - Former government spokesperson Themba Maseko says he believes there are a number of public servants who have information relevant to the state capture inquiry but they're afraid of coming forward. Maseko is the fourth witness to come forward with evidence of how the Guptas, with former President Jacob Zuma's assistance, tried to force him to redirect R600 million of government advertising to the New Age newspaper. He is one of three people who will testify about government’s payments directly or indirectly to Gupta-owned media agencies. Maseko has also referred to a statement signed by former director generals calling for a state capture inquiry. He believes they will be able to provide relevant information to the commission. “I am convinced that there are a number of public servants who have had experiences with a number of individuals, including the Gupta family, but it could also be pertaining to the conduct and behaviour of their political bosses [such as] ministers, MECs and premiers.” Maseko says he believes these individuals haven’t come forward because they fear they will lose their jobs.
