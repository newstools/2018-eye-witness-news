It seeks to highlight the importance of the whole society approach to ending the scourge of woman and child abuse. The provincial government says violence against women and children is a disgrace to the whole of humanity. On Wednesday, provincial cabinet members signed a pledge in support of the call to end such violent crimes. The Western Cape Health Department's Colleen Smart says the most recent statistics reveal 21% of women over the age of 18 reported abuse by their partners. Six percent reported sexual abuse.
