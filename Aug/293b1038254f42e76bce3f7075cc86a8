Former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas gives testimony at the state capture inquiry. JOHANNESBURG - Former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas is giving testimony at the state capture inquiry. He has made a number of explosive revelations during his testimony. He says that during the meeting where he was offered the R600 million by the Gupta family, he was told that the family owns everything and that if he worked with them he would become very rich. Jonas adds that he confided in the then Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene and Pravin Gordhan about the incident and was told by both of them to not yet tender his resignation. Jonas also told Nene that he will be removed as minister. Jonas says the following about Nene's unceremonious removal: "Pressure from then-President Jacob Zuma to approve the nuclear deal on us was immense and was ultimately the trigger that led to the removal of Nene as minister. The nuclear deal at the time was a big issue... I was on a flight to PE [Port Elizabeth] when Mr Nene was removed." 'The axe has fallen,' a text from Nene to Jonas at the time read.
