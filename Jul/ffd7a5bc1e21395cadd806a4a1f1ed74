PSL chairman Irvin Khoza confirmed that they will still challenge Judge Denise Fisher’s decision to set aside Advocate William Mokhari’s decision to dock Ajax Cape Town log points for fielding Tendai Ndoro. JOHANNESBURG - The Premier Soccer League  has confirmed that the 2018/19 PSL season will start as planned on 3 August despite their decision to challenge Judge Denise Fisher’s decision to set aside a decision to reinstate Ajax Cape Town to the premier division. Following a national Soccer League board members meeting at the Sandton Convention Centre on Thursday, PSL chairman Dr Irvin Khoza confirmed that they will still challenge Judge Fisher’s decision to set aside Advocate William Mokhari’s decision to dock Ajax Cape Town log points for fielding striker Tendai Ndoro, which ultimately relegated the Urban Warriors to the national first division. Ndoro, who had represented two clubs prior to joining Ajax, could not play for his new club as per the Fifa rules.  There were fears that the new PSL season was going to be delayed until the Ndoro issue was resolved but Khoza says that no matter what the outcome of their appeal is, the league will start on time. “We have been proactive in this matter and have asked for an urgent date for us to hear this matter as sponsors are banking on the league to start on time. Whatever the outcome of the appeal is, we are determined to start the league on time.” The issue could still be referred back to the Fifa's Players Status Committee to make a ruling, depending on the outcome of the PSL’s appeal.
