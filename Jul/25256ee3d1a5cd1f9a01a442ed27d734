Novichok is a Russian-designed and made nerve agent but the Kremlin is denying any involvement and says it’s deeply concerned about the incident. LONDON – The Russian government says accusations that it has been involved in the nerve agent poisoning in the UK, which has left one person dead, are “absurd”. A mother of three has died after coming into contact with novichok, more than three months after the poison was used to target a former Russian spy. The 44-year-old mother of three died a week after falling ill. Her poisoning and the attack on the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter happened just a few miles apart. However, the time period between the poisonings is more than three months and experts now believe the dead woman might have come into contact with the container used to store the poison.
