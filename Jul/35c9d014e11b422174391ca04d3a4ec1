He suffered a heart attack in Malaysia on Tuesday. CAPE TOWN - Legendary South African Cricket Board (SACB) all-rounder Saait Magiet has passed away at the age of 66. Magiet was arguably the leading bowling all-rounder for the non-racial SACB during apartheid. He suffered a heart attack in Malaysia on Tuesday. A stalwart for Western Province (WP), Magiet was the focal point behind the Western Province Cricket Board's dominance of the Howa Bowl during the 1970s and 80s. A classic all-rounder, who combined being a dashing and cavalier-style middle-order batsman and opening bowler - Majiet played 67 matches for WP, scoring 2 650 runs including three centuries and 15 half-centuries. He also took 169 wickets at an average of 12.71. He missed out on playing for South Africa due to apartheid and was a committed member of the non-racial Sacos until he retired in 1991. Majiet also captained the City and Suburban Board rugby team as a fearsome loose forward. After unification, Magiet tried his hand at coaching, and his success continued with the Western Province under-19 Khaya Majola team for a number of years. In 2015, Cricket South Africa honoured him with an official national team blazer.
