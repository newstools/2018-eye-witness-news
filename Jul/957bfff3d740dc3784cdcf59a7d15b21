Proteas left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi took match figures of 4/128 in the Proteas humiliating 278 run defeats in the first Test in Galle which only lasted three days. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsiâ€™s participation in the second Test against Sri Lanka is in doubt following his return to South Africa on family reasons. Shamsi took match figures of 4/128 in the Proteas humiliating 278 run defeats in the first Test in Galle which only lasted three days. South Africa were bowled out for 73 in their second innings chasing 351 for victory. It is unclear when Shamsi will return to the sub-continental country, which leaves the door open for a possible Test debut for leg-spinner Shaun von Berg should Ottis Gibson and the selectors continue with the two spinners approach in Colombo. The second Test match gets underway on Friday morning.
