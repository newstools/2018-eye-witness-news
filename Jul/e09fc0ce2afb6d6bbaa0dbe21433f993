At Wimbledon, South African beat Roger Federer in the quarter-finals in a lengthy and thrilling five-set match and then beat John Isner in the semi-finals in a match that lasted over six hours. LONDON - There are calls for the ways in which a fifth set are decided to be altered following two mammoth matches played by Kevin Anderson. At Wimbledon, the South African beat Roger Federer in the quarter-finals in a lengthy and thrilling five-set match and then beat John Isner in the semi-finals in a match that lasted over six hours. Some argue it's not surprising he lost the final after the marathon matches with insufficient rest time. Currently, the fifth set at Wimbledon is never decided by a tiebreaker. Instead, in close games which reach 5-all in the final set, the players continue to play until one of them gets two games ahead. Anderson played two such matches consecutively in the final week of Wimbledon with the semi-final against American Isner lasting six hours and 36 minutes. Fifty games were played in the last set alone in what was also the longest single-day match ever at the grass-court tournament. The change to introduce fifth-set tiebreaks, when it comes, may become known as the Anderson Rule.
