Noah has expanded on his comments in which he said that Africa and not France won the World Cup. JOHANNESBURG – South African comedian Trevor Noah says he is shocked at how many French people got angry over his make-up of World Cup team comments. Noah joked that Africa, not France, won the 2018 Fifa World Cup. “Africa won the World Cup. I get it, they have to say it’s the French team. But look at those guys. You don’t get that tan by hanging out in the south of France, my friends.” The comedian then read out a letter from the French ambassador to the United States, Gerard Araud, in a French accent of course... oui oui!  “They are French citizens and are proud of their country, France. The rich and various backgrounds of these players is a reflection of France’s diversity,” Noah read. “That line is interesting, I’m not trying to be an asshole but I think it’s more a reflection of France’s colonialism." The comedian went on to argue that black people all over the world were celebrating the African-ness in a positive way. “When I’m saying ‘African’ I’m not saying it to exclude them from their French-ness, I’m saying it to include them in my African-ness… When I’m saying they’re African I’m not saying it to exclude it from their French-ness but I’m using it to include it in my African-ness,” Noah added.
