The Urban Warriors had been relegated to the National First Division when they were docked points for illegally fielding Zimbabwean striker Tendai Ndoro. CAPE TOWN/JOHANNESBURG - The Western Cape High Court has ruled in favour of Ajax Cape Town regarding the Zimbabwean striker Tendai Ndoro eligibility matter. Ajax were relegated to the National First Division because they fielded Ndoro in three league matches. The club then asked the High Court to set aside that decision. Ajax Cape Town will play in the Premier Soccer League again next season after their bid to set aside the ruling for arbiter Advocate William Mokhari was successful on Monday. The ruling restores Ajax Cape Town’s points and replaces them back to 15th position on the PSL log and out of the automatic relegation places, which also means that Amazulu who were pushed out of the top eight, return and SuperSport drop down to 11th. The ruling also puts a spanner in the PSL’s works as it might be forced to replay the Promotion/Relegation play-offs which Black Leopards won or expand the league to 18 teams with four dropping out at the end of next season. The new league season is set to get underway in just over a months’ time but could be delayed should the PSL decide to replay the Promotion/Relegation play-offs and Leopards could also head to court should that be the case.
