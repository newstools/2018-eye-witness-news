John Comitis confirmed he and Gavin Hunt discussed likely transfers between the two clubs whilst in Russia at the World Cup CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City chairman John Comitis  has told EWN Sport that no deal has been agreed for winger Lyle Lakay but confirmed there was genuine interest from two clubs up the country. “I know that Wits had given us an indication that they wanted him and Sundowns also at some point. But, I have done no deal with anybody as we speak.” Comitis confirmed he and Gavin Hunt (Wits head coach) discussed likely transfers between the two clubs while in Russia at the World Cup “When I was in Russia, I was speaking to Gavin Hunt about the possibilities of Lyle going there. I’m interested in one of the players at Wits, which is why I would entertain it.” The positive aspect for Lakay’s current suitors is that the former Bloemfontein Celtic winger is willing to relocate, according to Comitis. “Lyle has shown an indication that he would like to move if he can.” City have a plethora of talented attacking wingers on their books, plus they have added Riyaad Norodien from Orlando Pirates this off season. So it’s possible they would want to let go of certain players, seeing that their attacking positions are currently saturated.
