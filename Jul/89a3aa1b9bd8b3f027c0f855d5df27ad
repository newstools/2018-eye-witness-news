He was speaking at a mining summit in Boksburg on Saturday morning. Mantashe says the draft Mining Charter is aimed at managing transformation in order for the industry to open for people who were historically disadvantaged. A number of stakeholders are expected to share their views on the mining charter that is open for public comment until 27 July. Mantashe says transformation must not be accepted merely for compliance, but it must be regarded as a necessary intervention. “When there’s change it means we cannot continue doing things as we do things here. We are busy with transformation. That transformation is dealing with our long ugly history, where Africans in particular and black people in general were excluded in everything, including economic activity.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
