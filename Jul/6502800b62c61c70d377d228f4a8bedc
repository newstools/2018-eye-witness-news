The Tesla CEO has also come under fire for making donations to a Republican fundraising committee. British diver Vern Unsworth has told an Australian news network he’s considering legal action over the baseless accusation Musk made to his 22 million Twitter followers, calling Unsworth a “pedo” short for paedophilein tweets that have since been deleted. Musk has been mired in more controversy over donations he’s made to a Republican fundraising committee, he has denied being one of the party’s top donors, but he hasn’t denied the donations which some political pundits feel alienates him from liberals. Musk says he donates to both parties to maintain dialogue but that he gives more to humanitarian causes.   (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
