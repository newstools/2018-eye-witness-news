The Western Cape Health Department says it's been left no choice but to close the Hermanus Community Day Centre due to the protests in Zwelihle. The situation has been volatile in that area for several months now as the community demonstrates over land and service delivery. However, it's not yet clear what sparked the current demonstrations. Health Department spokesperson Simone Carelse said: “The department regrets to inform the public that the Hermanus Community Day Centre is closed due to unrest in Zwelihle. "Hopefully, we’ll be open tomorrow. Patients are asked to visit their nearest clinics for medical treatment and for emergencies, to go to Hermanus Hospital.”
