Collective dam levels have increased by more than 5% over the past week, bumping up levels to just over 41%. CAPE TOWN - Heavy downpours in recent days have brought about much-needed relief for the Western Cape's dam system. The provincial Local Government and Environmental Affairs Department says major dam levels have all increased by more than 5 percentage points in the past week. The average dam level is 41.5% this week, compared to 36.2% a week ago. Cape Town catchment dams are currently 48.3% full, the Berg River dam level stands at about 66% and the Olifants River catchment levels are recorded at just over 68%. But the Gouritz water catchment area hasn't improved and is just over 19% full. This dam supplies water to the Klein Karoo area. Local government’s James-Brent Styan says: “The average levels for dams in the province currently stands at 41.5%. Last year at this time we were at 23.6%. So it’s quite better. But two years ago we were at 46%, so we’re not where we were two years ago.” Officials are, however, continuing to encourage residents to keep up water-saving efforts, as the drought is still considered to be in effect in parts of the province.
