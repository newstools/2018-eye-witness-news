Bo-Kaap has been the site of conflict as clashes between disgruntled residents and developers have played out on three separate occasions. Ward councillor Brandon Golding says talks between stakeholders have begun. “I’ve met with representatives of Bo-Kaap civic. We’ve seemed to have pulled in members of all the various organisations [and] we’ve had multiple meetings with regards to housing, what it is they like to look at in a social housing sense. So that’s currently being focused on.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
