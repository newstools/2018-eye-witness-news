Without mentioning China’s trade enemy, the United States, Jinping has called on BRICS countries to resist the increasing push for protectionism. He also condemned the growing attacks and multilateralism. Since US President Donald Trump took office he has resorted to protectionism, where he’s relying on high tariffs to boost US industry and shield it from foreign competition.
