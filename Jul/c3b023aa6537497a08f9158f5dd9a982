Some members interdicted the conference from going ahead last month because of concerns about poor planning ahead of the event. JOHANNESBURG – The KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) task team has confirmed that its provincial elective conference is now scheduled to take place next week. Some members interdicted the conference from going ahead last month because of concerns about poor planning ahead of the event. The task team says its decision to hold the conference from 19 to 21 July was made after all members agreed on the date and other concerns. The task team's convenor Mike Mabuyakhulu said: “We have been in discussions with the members who were taking the ANC to court. We have now reached consensus with all those unhappy members. We now think we are ready for us to have a new date for the conference, based on the fact that issues which were the bone of contention have now been addressed.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
