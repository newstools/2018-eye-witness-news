The mobile app was granted a temporary licence renewal to operate in Britain’s capital. LONDON - London taxi drivers are exploring whether they could bring a class action lawsuit against Uber, their trade body confirmed on Tuesday after the mobile app was granted a temporary licence renewal to operate in Britain’s capital. “We’ve been approached by a number of members to help them explore whether there would be grounds for a potential class action on behalf of all taxi drivers against Uber,” Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, said in a statement. “We are in the very early stages of obtaining legal advice from leading law firm Mishcon de Reya on whether this is a possibility,” he added. Sky News had previously reported the plan.
