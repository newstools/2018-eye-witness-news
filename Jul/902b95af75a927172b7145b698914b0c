England take on Belgium in the third and fourth place playoff. JOHANNESBURG - The penultimate match in the 2018 Fifa World Cup takes place on Saturday afternoon when England take on Belgium in the third and fourth place playoff. In recent World Cup campaigns, the game usually produces a flurry of goals. England’s Key Players: Harry Kane: A stand-out key player for England throughout the tournament, the Tottenham Hotspur striker showed composure throughout the tournament. He's a threat in front of goal and will be secure of the Golden Boot, for the tournament, with a few goals against the Belgians. Some may argue that he was restricted since the group stages, but his maturity will surely keep his head held high. Jordan Pickford: Despite conceding two against Croatia, Pickford has been one of the unsung heroes for the English side throughout this World Cup. His poise in goal gives his defence confidence during set-pieces and crosses. He commands his defence well and will have to be in top form against the likes of Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku. Belgium's Key Players: Eden Hazard: The Chelsea midfielder was exceptional against France. He was unlucky not to have opened the scoring with a curling shot heading towards the top corner. His dribbling, direct runs from midfield and brilliant passing will be a challenge for England’s defence - if Romelu Lukaku performs in the complete opposite manner than he did against France. Nacer Chadli: The former Spurs and West Bromwich Albion man has been very impressive. He has hugged the touchline on both wings throughout the World Cup. His hard work paid off when he scored the winner against Japan in the knockout stages. If his World Cup performance is anything to go by, he can expect offers from a number of clubs to lure him from the Hawthorns. Ahmed’s prediction: England 1-2 Belgium
