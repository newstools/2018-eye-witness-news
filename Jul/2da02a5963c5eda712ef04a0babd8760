Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema says that racism should no longer be tolerated. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says there is no place for white and Indian supremacy in the country. Malema was addressing thousands of supporters in the Eastern Cape on Saturday as the party celebrated its 5th year anniversary. He says that racism should no longer be tolerated. “Everywhere, where we find racism we must crush it. Whether it’s done by a white man or an Indian, we must finish it.” Malema caused controversy, earlier this day, during a Youth Day speech in the North West where he hit out at Indians, saying that they were racists.  Malema condemned the current African National Congress-led government for corruption. The controversial leader told supporters that his party will lead in 2019, regardless of voting results. At the same time, Malema says the only way for South Africa to attain equality in society is to prioritise education. He’s called on the youth to embrace opportunities to learn. “Please young people go to school, education is free, and we call upon the Education Department to release the results of students who have passed.”  Malema encouraged black South Africans to go to university and pave the way for future generations. “You must know that when you enter that university we’re going to invest money in you. And when you fail it’s a wasteful expenditure, and wasteful expenditure is punishable… you shall pay.”  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
