The NUM says unions are still deciding whether to accept the latest offer. JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has confirmed Eskom has raised its wage offer to 7%. It’s the second increased offer on Friday after the labour unions rejected the previous proposal of 6.2%. Workers have been pushing for a figure of around 9%. The NUM’s Livhuwani Mamburu says unions are still deciding whether to accept the latest offer. “With the latest offer of 7%, we’re not going to consider year agreement. They want a multi-year agreement of three years, but we have not decided whether to accept or reject their offer.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
