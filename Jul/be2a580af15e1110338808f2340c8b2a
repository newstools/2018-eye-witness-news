The SAPS says detectives are working around the clock trying to solve the murder of one of their own, but they have yet to make any arrests. CAPE TOWN - Family members have described a slain Delft constable as a dedicated police officer who only ever wanted to serve. Constable Vuyo Kosani was shot in Mfuleni on 4 July. On Wednesday, friends and family held a memorial service for the late constable. Kosani’s brother has told Eyewitness News that the 22-year-old officer will be buried in the Eastern Cape. Unathi Matshoba attended his younger brother’s memorial service in Delft on Wednesday. He says all he ever wanted to be was a member of the SA Police Service. “He was a very dedicated cop. It’s sad, especially with the cops being killed every day. If he was killed for being a cop… that’s what he wanted, he wanted to die as a soldier.” The SAPS says detectives are working around the clock trying to solve the murder of one of their own, but they have yet to make any arrests. Kosani was off-duty when he was shot. He’d spent the evening socialising with friends in Mfuleni. WATCH: Cele visits the family of a slain off-duty Mfuleni officer  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
