Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille says she's positive about a new process that will restart the disciplinary process against her. CAPE TOWN - Mayor Patricia De Lille says she's happy the Democratic Alliance (DA) has agreed to allow her to defend herself in public. According to an agreement reached on Wednesday night with the top leadership that included party leader Mmusi Maimane, the DA will have to charge De Lille from scratch. But the decision has increased unhappiness within the DA caucus which had hoped to remove her through a motion of no confidence at a full council meeting on Thursday. WATCH: De Lille feels positive after MONC against her is withdrawn  The Cape Town mayor says she's positive about a new process that will restart the disciplinary process against her. Three days will be set aside in August for legal teams to consider reformulated charges. "I also owe the country to give them my side of the story. And my ultimate aim is to clear my name, there are lots of untested allegations out there in the public without evidence." According to the agreement reached, the DA's city caucus will not be allowed to table another motion of no confidence in her. De Lille says those who want her gone, should wait for the outcome of the disciplinary process. 'MATURE PROCESS' The DA says the agreement reached with De Lille is the responsible and mature process to follow. Findings in an upcoming Bowman Gilfillan report, probing alleged corruption cover-ups by De Lille in the city will form part of the charge sheet. De Lille has denied these allegations. Deputy chairperson of the DA's Federal Council Natasha Mazzone said: “Given that there has been a lot of confusion around this issue and there has been for some time, we believe in accountability in our party. It is one of the principles we believe in and for that, we have taken steps to ensure that we practice what we preach which is an open, transparent and accountable government.” (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
