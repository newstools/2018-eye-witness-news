AIX-EN-PROVENCE - The French government is considering capping fees banks apply on poor clients as part of a poverty plan being hammered out, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. The plan was originally intended to be presented this week but the government decided to postpone it after the summer break to make further tweaks, Le Maire said. “I still need a little time to discuss with the banks and associations,” Le Maire told an economic conference in Aix-en-Provence, southern France.
