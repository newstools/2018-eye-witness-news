In one incident, a driver is believed to have purposefully driven over the foot of an officer. In another incident, a traffic officer was robbed of his service pistol and cellphone. Mayco member for Safety and Security JP Smith said: “We call on the public to help us catch the people who robbed a traffic officer at gunpoint of his service pistol and cellphone under the pretext of needing directions.
