As South Africans buckle under the financial pressure of increasing fuel hikes and daily living costs following the increase of VAT to 15%, many are hoping for some relief from the Davis Tax Committee, currently reviewing the list of VAT zero-rated items.

Treasury says that it is expecting a report from the commission by the end of July.
