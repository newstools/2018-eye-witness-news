Rescuers say it will take many hours before the first boy emerges from the cave. JOHANNESBURG - Divers on Sunday launched an operation to rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave complex in northern Thailand. Rescuers say it will take many hours before the first boy emerges from the cave. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, went missing with the 25-year-old chaperone after soccer practice last month as they set out to explore the Tham Luang cave. CNN's Matt Rivers says the operation is underway. “There are 13 people underground and there’s always been two ambulances here. These are the clearest signs yet that this rescue attempt is imminent.” A large media contingent began packing up equipment including tripods and cameras and moving down a muddy hill away from the mouth of the limestone cave. Following a relatively dry spell, fresh torrential downpours could pose a setback to rescuers who have struggled to drain the Tham Luang cave complex in the northern province of Chiang Rai. Weather.com forecast sustained thunderstorms lasting through Sunday and Monday, with further stormy weather expected for around the next two weeks. Time is running out on a plan to teach the boys - some as young as 11 and not strong swimmers - to make a dive through dark, narrow passageways sometimes no more than 0.6- metre wide, that have challenged some of the world’s leading cave divers.
