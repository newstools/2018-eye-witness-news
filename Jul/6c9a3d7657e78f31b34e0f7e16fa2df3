JOHANNESBURG - Billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has shared photos and videos of a metallic pod that may help rescue a group of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand. Scuba divers in Thailand have already rescued four of the 12 boys who have been stranded, along with their coach, in a flooded cave. Musk shared a video of a group testing the device in a Los Angeles high school swimming pool on his Twitter account.  Earlier this week, Musk offered engineers from two of his other companies — SpaceX and The Boring Company — to assist the Thai government. The video shows three people in scuba gear pushing and pulling the tube across a pool.  Eight members of the soccer team, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach remain trapped in the cave. Officials said the rescue could take four days to complete. The team has been trapped in the cave for two weeks.
