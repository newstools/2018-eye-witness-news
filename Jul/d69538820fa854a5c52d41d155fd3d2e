Kaizer Chiefs on Friday announced Giovanni Solinas as their new head coach. JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs have ended long speculation on who will be their new head coach following the departure of Steve Khompela. The Soweto based club announced that former Free State Stars coach Giovanni Solinas will take over the reins at Naturena. The 50-year-old Italian had two stints at Free State Stars between 2015 and 2017 and returns to the Premier Soccer League in one of the league's toughest jobs. Solinas comes in two months after the departure of Khompela and will take over from Patrick Mabhedi who was acting in the role. Solinasâ€™ first assignment at Chiefs will be a preseason friendly in the Shell Helix Cup against reigning PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns at the FNB Stadium on 21 July.
