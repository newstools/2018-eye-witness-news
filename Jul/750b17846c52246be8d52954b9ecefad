President Cyril Ramaphosa says billions of rands have been syphoned off from the state as a result of corruption. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa has sounded the call for a massive campaign to recoup money lost through government corruption. Ramaphosa addressed the opening of the African National Congress (ANC) Gauteng provincial conference in Irene on Friday afternoon. The president says billions of rands have been syphoned off from the state as a result of corruption. Now he says it’s time to go after those who stole state funds. “We must now be saying we want that money back because that money must go for pay for health and schools.” Ramaphosa says the electorate wants to see determination from the ANC to root out corruption. The president further warned that next year’s general election will be hard fought, and the ANC cannot rely merely on loyalty to the party. MAKHURA DECRIES GOVERNMENT INCOMPETENCE Acting ANC Gauteng chairperson David Makhura has hit out at the practice of deploying ANC members and leaders to top positions in government without training. Delivering the political report at the party's provincial conference on Friday afternoon, Makhura warned this practice will undermine efforts by the ANC to clean up the state. He says the party must not make the mistake of covering up incompetence. “When comrades are given the responsibilities above their level of competence, they will be a newling death. They will fail not only the ANC [but also] the masses. It doesn’t matter how good they are, they are half [competent].” Makhura is expected to be elected the provincial ANC chairperson unopposed at the conference this weekend.
