Workers affiliated to United Transport & Allied Trade Union (Untu) went on strike after wage negotiations with Gautrain operator Bombela deadlocked on Saturday. JOHANNESBURG – Gautrain has accused its striking workers of preventing buses from exiting the depot, causing delays to services in Centurion, Sandton and Park Station. Workers affiliated to United Transport & Allied Trade Union (Untu) went on strike after wage negotiations with Gautrain operator Bombela deadlocked on Saturday. The transport union is demanding a 10% salary hike and to see Bombela's financial statements. Bombela is offering 8.5%. Untu says that its members will remain on strike until Gautrain management makes what they call a more reasonable offer. Untu's Steve Harris says: “We’re still available to be called should they be prepared to put a new offer that’s reasonable and that we can take to our constituency and the constituency will decide how long that they’re prepared to last out on this strike action.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
