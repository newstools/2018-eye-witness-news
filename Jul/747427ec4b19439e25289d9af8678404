JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says there will be a lot of cleaning up to do should his party win the Gauteng province during elections next year. Speaking at the party's Gauteng provincial council meeting in Centurion on Friday, Maimane urged all premier candidates to rally behind the person who will be selected. Maimane says the state of governance in Gauteng has deteriorated and it's up to his party to fix it should it win the province. “When we take over Gauteng, we’ve got a lot of work to do. We have to fight against things like Life Esidimeni where the ANC killed 140 people.” The party has received nine applications of those contesting to be premier candidates, the highest the party has received in any province. Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga and national spokesperson Refiloe Nt'sekhe being among those whom have thrown their hat in the ring. Maimane says he personally has no endeavours to become premier of any province because he has not joined politics for positions. He says his job is to ensure that South Africans trusts the DA as an alternative to the African National Congress at the ballot papers. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
