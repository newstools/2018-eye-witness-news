Melania Trump's facial expression after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin has sparked Twitter reactions. JOHANNESBURG – US first lady Melania Trump showed either a shocked, awed, confused, horrified, or a combination-of-everything expression after shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Melania joined her husband US President Donald Trump during a meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland, where the two world leaders reportedly discussed how to improve relations between their two nations. In a video, after shaking hands and a brief spoken exchange with Putin, Mrs Trump, in a yellow coat, turns to the glare of the cameras with a strange, frozen expression on her face.  This is the latest tense, secondhand-embarrassment-producing moment for the First Lady, beginning with Trump leaving her in the dust while greeting the Obamas on Inauguration Day in 2017.
