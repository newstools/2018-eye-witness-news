Make-up, baby powder and coffee may all be banned from being carried on to the plane on all flights leaving Britain. LONDON â€“ It's reported that the UK is about to introduce tough new security measures for air passengers hand luggage. Make-up, baby powder and coffee may all be banned from being carried on to the plane on all flights leaving Britain. Security measures have been under review around the world's airports following a foiled plot to blow up an Etihad flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi last year. Thought to be inspired by Islamic State plotters attempted to get an explosive onto the plane last July. However, they were being monitored and were stopped at security. Now, the UK in line with the US, Australia and New Zealand seems set to introduce new restrictions on hand luggage. Spices, protein powder, make-up, baby powder and coffee are among the items which must now be limited to 12 ounces or 56 grams and shown to security in a transparent bag.
