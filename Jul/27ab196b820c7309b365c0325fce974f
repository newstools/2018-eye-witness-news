On Thursday, the PSL’s executive committee met to decided a way forward to resolve the issue. JOHANNESBURG - The Premier Soccer League has announced that it will seek leave to appeal the decision made by Judge Denise Fisher to reinstate Ajax Cape Town back into the Premier League. Ajax had been relegated to the National First Division after another court decision ruled that they had illegally fielded striker Tendai Ndoro during the season and were docked points which ultimately relegated the Cape outfit. On Thursday, the PSL’s executive committee met to decided a way forward to resolve the issue. The resolution was that they would seek to appeal the decision, but further details would be provided after a National Soccer League board meeting scheduled for Thursday, 12 July. The PSL faces a difficult predicament as Black Leopards also won the Promotion Relegation series in June.
