In a statement released by the ICC, Dave Richardson says he felt that stepping down after the World Cup next year was the right time. JOHANNESBURG - The International Cricket Council on Tuesday announced that chief executive officer Dave Richardson will step down from his position when his contract expires at the end of the Cricket World Cup in the United Kingdom in 2019. The former South African wicket-keeper batsman has occupied the position since 2012. Richardson had previously held the position of ICC general manager for cricket in 2002, becoming the first person to hold the position. In a statement released by the ICC, Richardson says he felt that stepping down after the World Cup next year was the right time. “The hardest thing as a cricketer is knowing when the time is right to retire. But for me, the end of the ICC cricket World Cup next year is about right. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the ICC and I am particularly pleased with what we have achieved in recent times in creating greater context for all formats of the game and securing increased opportunities and clear pathways for all members to play at the highest level.”
