Officers have arrested nurse Lucy Letby on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of another six at one British hospital where she is currently employed. LONDON – A second British hospital has been included in a police investigation examining the deaths of babies. Officers have arrested 28-year-old Lucy Letby on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of another six at one British hospital where she is currently employed. However, it's been revealed the nurse completed a placement at another hospital nearby which had also noted some unusual baby deaths. Officers from the north west of England are investigating the deaths of 17 infants at the Countess of Chester Hospital. They are also investigating 15 non-fatal collapses at the neonatal unit over a 16-month period ending July 2016. The probe is part of a lengthy investigation into a higher-than-expected baby mortality rate at the hospital. Nurse Letby is reported to be in custody while officers search her home and the home of her parents. The investigation has now been extended to include the Liverpool Women’s Hospital after it was revealed Letby had completed a placement at that unit.
