The ANC's Head of Policy says the elections manifesto workshops will help the governing party come up with a document that deals with all issues facing South Africans. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has admitted that people are tired of the party’s talk of its policies without implementation. The party is holding a manifesto consultative meeting with its government deployees at Luthuli House on Sunday, attended by ministers, deputy ministers, premiers and mayors. The gathering is part of processes to develop the ANC’s 2019 elections manifesto. ANC Head of Policy Jeff Radebe says the party wants to access the progress in government. “The successes, challenges and how we’re going to be addressing them.” He says South Africans are tired of talk without action. “That’s why people are very tired of plans and even planning to plan. We need action, that’s why this manifesto must be the real people manifesto that must respond to the challenges.” He says the elections manifesto workshops will help the ANC come up with a document that deals with all issues facing South Africans. At the same time, the ANC has announced that it will embark on elections manifesto forums throughout its provinces, saying it wants to listen to concerns raised by South Africans and help fix challenges faced by communities. Radebe says, “This manifesto must reflect the wishes and aspirations of our communities. That’s why from this meeting today, we’re going to be visiting all provinces in manifesto forums. We’re going to be listening, seeing but also to fix what is wrong in our communities.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
