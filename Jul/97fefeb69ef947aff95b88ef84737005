JOHANNESBURG - Social media has mocked the English football team after their 2-1 semifinal loss to Croatia at the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday night. England scored in the 5th minute through a stunning freekick from fullback Kieran Trippier before winger Ivan Perisic equalized for Croatia to send the tie into extra time. Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic scored the winner deep into the second half of extra time to set up a World Cup Final meeting with France in Moscow on Sunday. The English players had famously coined the phrase ‘Its coming home’ throughout the World Cup campaign, referring to football returning to its original birth place. Twitter's reaction to the loss was not kind to the English team.
