The governing party, SACP, Cosatu and Sanco will be meeting to discuss a wide range of issues. JOHANNESBURG - The long-awaited African National Congress (ANC)-led alliance political council is expected to begin today. The governing party, South African Communist Party, Congress of South African Trade Unions and SA National Civic Organisation will be meeting to discuss a wide range of issues, including the reconfiguration of the alliance. This political council meeting is significant because it’s the first since Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president of the ANC in December. The party says it will discuss the state of the alliance, the strengthening of the relations amongst the partners and how the organisations can work together to build one another. The reconfiguration of the alliance will also be on the table. The SACP’s Solly Mapaila says the party wants to change the manner in which the current alliance operates. The meeting is expected to conclude on Monday. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
