JOHANNEBSURG – Premier Soccer League champions Mamelodi Sundowns have unveiled their new Puma kit for 2018/19 season. In keeping with their traditional yellow and blue, the designs of the second kit look more unique on the sleeves, with some blue stripes to highlight the blend of yellow and blue. Puma South Africa marketing director Brett Bellinger says: “The campaign talks to the singing and dancing which has become a trademark of the team and the players, but also connects everyone through their daily hustle as they live and work in South Africa and prepare for each Sundowns football match.” The Brazilians spokesperson Thulani Thuswa said the club is delighted with the new kit. “This is definitely a jersey fit for a club as ambitious and progressive as Mamelodi Sundowns. The evoKNIT technology featured in the new jerseys is ahead of its time, as Puma once again leads the market with unique designs and continues to put the Brazilians ahead of the pack.”
