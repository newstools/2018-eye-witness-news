MOSCOW - Hollywood actor and singer Will Smith performed the soccer World Cup’s official song Live It Up in the tournament’s closing ceremony in Moscow on Sunday.

In the final sequence of the ceremony, Russian opera singer Aida Garifullina performed Russian folk song Kalinka accompanied by bagpipes, a children’s choir, and a percussion section.

The performances were a prelude to France and Croatia’s players taking to the pitch to begin their final match, in front of a packed crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium.
