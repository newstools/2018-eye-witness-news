JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has congratulated attacker Percy Tau on his move to English Premier League side Brighton and Hove Albion on a four-year deal. The English Club confirmed the deal on Friday afternoon, which is expected to be worth in the region of R50 million. Though Tau has made the move to the club, it is widely expected that he will be shipped to Brighton’s sister club Royale Union Saint-Gilloise on a loan deal. Tau’s mentor at Sundowns, Mosimane said that he was delighted for the young attacker. “Everyone at Mamelodi Sundowns is happy for Percy, we said from the start that we would only entertain offers from the top five leagues in Europe and for Percy to go to Brighton is great,” Mosimane also said that the transfer of Tau and others that have gone to Europe before him can only make Bafana Bafana stronger in the future. “It’s important that these guys like Percy, Keegan Dolly and Bongani Zungu go to these European clubs, it can only make South African football stronger and Bafana will benefit from these guys playing abroad.” All three Absa Premier League Players of the season from the past four seasons have gone on and plied their trade in Europe. The 2014/15 player of the season winner Tefu Mashamaite plays for BK Haken of Sweden, while Lebohang Manyama, who won the player of the season in 2016/17, went on to play for Konyaspor in Turkey. Sundowns get their Premier Soccer League preparations underway on Saturday when they take on Kaizer Chiefs in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup at the FNB Stadium. Kickoff is at 17:00.
