Amid a high exodus of players to overseas contracts from the Lions, the news comes as good news to all Lions and South African rugby fans. JOHANNESBURG - Springbok and Lions scrumhalf Ross Cronje has signed a two-year contract extension with the Johannesburg Franchise, which will keep him in the country until 2020. Amid a high exodus of players to overseas contracts from the Lions, the news comes as good news to all Lions and South African rugby fans. Cronje who has played 71 games for the Lions in Super Rugby and is one of the senior members of Swys de Bruyn’s outfit and was also capped 10 times by the Springboks in disastrous 2017 campaign under then coach Allister Coetzee. Cronje says he enjoys living in Johannesburg and being an hour’s flight away from the beach was also his motivation to resign with the Lions. “I have signed a two-year contract extension with the Lions. I enjoy being here, the bush is not too far away, the beach is just an hour’s flight away and the sun is always out here.” The news will also hopefully serve as motivation for the Lions who play their trans-jukskei rivals the Bulls in a must-win Super Rugby match in order to cement top spot in the South African conference and book a home quarter-final.
