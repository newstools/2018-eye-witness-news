In the run-up to next year's general elections, President Ramaphosa says the ANC must find ways to correct its wrongs. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says the African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng must seriously reflect on what went wrong in the party leading to the decline in electoral support in the 2016 local government elections. In the run-up to next year's general elections, Ramaphosa says the ANC must find ways to correct its wrongs. He was addressing the opening of the ANC Gauteng provincial conference in Irene on Friday.  Ramaphosa says while delegates diagnose the problems that led to it losing two metros in the province, delegates must not tear each other apart. “Delegates to this conference must necessarily, honestly assess the extent to which our weaknesses as leaders and as members contributed to the decline in electoral support, even among our traditional supporters.” He says the 2019 general elections will be hard fought, especially in Gauteng where opposition parties have set their sights on an electoral win. Ramaphosa has warned that people will not vote for the ANC merely out of loyalty. He says party members will have to work hard to convince people to support the ANC. “With the election, it is a key challenge we face but that election, comrades, it’s not going to result in votes for us because we are the ANC. It is going to take a lot of hard work and campaigning.”  (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
