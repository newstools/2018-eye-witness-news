The Jaguares have been an attacking threat throughout the competition and Warren Whiteley believes that they can not afford to have a bad start on Saturday. JOHANNESBURG - Emirates Lions Captain Warren Whiteley says his side needs to start well against the Jaguares in their Super Rugby quarterfinal match at Ellis Park on Saturday. The Lions are playing their fourth consecutive playoff game, while the Argentine side is visiting this stage of the competition for the very first time. The Jaguares have been an attacking threat throughout the competition and Whiteley believes that they cannot afford to have a bad start on Saturday. “We need to start better than what we did against the Bulls last Saturday against a very dangerous Jaguares side. It's going to be very important that we do start well and remain consistent throughout the 80 minutes on Saturday.” Coach Swys de Bruin has made minimal changes to the run on side. In a rotational policy, de Bruin has brought back Springbok winger Aphiwe Dyantyi in the place of Courtnall Skosan who drops back down to the bench. Ross Cronjé replaces the injured Nic Groom who underwent surgery for a broken hand on Tuesday sustained in the match against the Bulls last Saturday. Groom will miss the remainder of the Super Rugby competition. Dylan Smith makes his way onto the bench after recovering from a calf strain sustained against the Sharks, as do Dillon Smit, the replacement scrumhalf.
