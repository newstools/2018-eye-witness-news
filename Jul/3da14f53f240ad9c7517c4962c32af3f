JOHANNESBURG - Springbok Captain Siya Kolisi  has been nominated for the Laureus Sports Moment award for the month of June, after being elected the first black African Springbok Captain for the three-Test match series against England. Kolisi led the Boks to a 2-1 series victory, with wins in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein in the first Test matches. The nomination highlights Kolisi’s upbringing from the Port Elizabeth township of Zwide and his rise to international rugby stardom and ultimately leading South Africa in Test matches. The other nominees include seven-year-old Pakistani leg-spin bowler Eli who blew up on the internet for posting videos of him bowling leg-spin like Australian legend Shane Warne. Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta’s farewell from the Catalan giants after spending 22 years with the club also cracks the nod, while a tribute to the 2017 Manchester terror attack by Nathan Rae, who runs through the city also features on the nomination list.
