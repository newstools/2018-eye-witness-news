The two teams will meet at 8pm to secure a place in the final. JOHANNESBURG - Belgium and France will do battle on Tuesday night for a spot in the 2018 World Cup final. There a number of impact players on both sides that could make for an exciting goal-filled match. Leading the line for both sides is Romelu Lukaku (Belgium) and Olivier Giroud (France). Giroud will be hoping for his first goal this World Cup. His counterpart has found the back of the net four times already and Lukaku goes into the game as the in-form striker. The fight for the creative crown back in midfield will be between Kevin de Bruyne (Belgium) and Paul Pogba (France). De Bruyn has already scored and assisted, whilst Pogba has been the Robin to Antoinne Griezmann’s Batman. The Manchester United midfielder, however, has completed 189 passes compared to de Bruyne’s 178. The tightest battle on the field is arguably between Frenchman Griezmann and Belgian Eden Hazard. Both players have been involved in four goals so far, with Hazard scoring two and assisting two, while Griezmann has scored three and assisted one (two of the goals have come from the spot). If both players fire on all cylinders on Tuesday night, the first semifinal promises to be an absolute goal fest. The last line of defence sees the French keeper going into the games slightly more confident. Hugo Lloris has three clean sheets, while Thibaut Courtois goes in with just two. Belgium conceded two avoidable goals against Tunisia and were left wanting against Japan. Red flags for the Red Devils in that department. Courtois was made to work 18 times so far compared to Lloris who was called into action just eight times. Both teams will need to do everything to ensure they win the midfield battle given the attacking talent on the field. In particular, Belgium will need to be strong at the back against the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Pogba and Griezmann.
