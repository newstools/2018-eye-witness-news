JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  says it cannot guarantee power supply following several acts of intimidation at some of its power stations. The utility says coal trucks have been hijacked and employees have been intimidated at the entrance of several stations starting at its Duvha operation in Mpumalanga. It's understood some workers are unhappy about the ongoing bonus dispute between Eskom and unions. A meeting between the parties will be held this Friday. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe says police have been monitoring the situation. “Even under normal circumstances, the risk of load shedding is always there. Now under abnormal situations like this, where people are blocking off the entrances of the power stations [and] intimidating others, we cannot guarantee security of power supply will continue uninterrupted.” Phasiwe says a conveyer belt used to transport coal was slashed with a sharp object earlier on Monday. “Management is doing everything possible to ensure that those people who are able to go in for their late shift, are able to help out where possible. So far, the power system is still holding.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
