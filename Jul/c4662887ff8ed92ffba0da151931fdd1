On Thursday, six members from the Lower South Coast and Moses Mabhida regions went to the Pietermaritzburg High Court in a bid to obtain another urgent interdict. DURBAN - The latest attempt to halt the KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress’ (ANC) elective conference has been struck off the roll and dismissed with costs. On Thursday, six members from the Lower South Coast and Moses Mabhida regions went to the Pietermaritzburg High Court in a bid to obtain another urgent interdict. It follows last month’s court action where aggrieved members from divided regions stopped the conference from going ahead. On Thursday night, new leaders are expected to be nominated once the credentials process has been verified. Judge Thoba Poyo-Dlwati has struck the latest court challenge by disgruntled regions off the roll. He says the matter isn’t urgent and that members had three days to launch their action but chose to do so on the day of the conference. Meanwhile, delegates are expected to begin arriving for the elective conference at the Durban University of Technology’s Sports Centre.
