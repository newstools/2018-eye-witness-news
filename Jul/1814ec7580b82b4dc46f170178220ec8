The Briton will return to England’s national stadium for fights on 22 September and 13 April, although his opponents have yet to be confirmed. LONDON - Anthony Joshua has signed a deal to stage his next two bouts at Wembley stadium, the first in September and then next April, the 28-year-old announced via promotions company Matchroom Boxing. The WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion beat Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley in April 2017 but his next two fights - a 10th round stoppage of Carlos Takam and points win over Joseph Parker — were at the Principality Stadium in Wales. The Briton will return to England’s national stadium for fights on 22 September and 13 April, although his opponents have yet to be confirmed. “Being north London born and raised, it is in my blood. The opportunity to fight in such an iconic stadium is normally a once-in-a-career opportunity, so to be given the chance to fight there again is amazing,” Joshua told Matchroom Boxing’s website. “Wembley just added a fourth lion to the den.” Joshua, who boasts an unbeaten 21-0 record, is expected to take on Russian WBA mandatory challenger Alexander Povetkin next with a title unification bout against WBC world champion Deontay Wilder also in the works. “I’m extremely honoured to get the opportunity to promote two more shows at the national stadium and delighted for British fight fans that Anthony has made this commitment to them,” Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn said. Hearn said on Twitter that the capacity for the September fight was expected to be around 90,000, while the April promotion could attract more than 100,000 spectators.
