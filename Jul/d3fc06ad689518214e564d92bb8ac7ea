JOHANNESBURG - Two people have been arrested in Hammanskraal, northern Pretoria, following ongoing protests in the area. The pair has been charged with public violence and malicious damage to property. Residents are demanding clean water and claim the taps in their community are contaminated. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela says residents have been pelting passing cars with stones. “The police and Metro police are busy opening the roads that were blocked by rubble and burning tyres.” In June, residents complained they had suffered gastric ailments after drinking water from the tap, prompting Tshwane health officials to investigate claims of a cholera outbreak. This was later dismissed after tests showed no traces of the disease. Additional reporting by Masechaba Sefularo. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
