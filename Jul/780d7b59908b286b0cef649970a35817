JOHANNESBURG – National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole has condemned the murder of 11 members of the Ivory Park Taxi Association. It’s understood the victims of the Joburg association had travelled to KwaZulu-Natal to attend the funeral of a colleague on Saturday.

Four of the passengers survived and they are now being treated in hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal.
