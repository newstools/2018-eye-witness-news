Mayor Msimanga says a process to find a new contractor to replace Project Isizwe is now at an advanced stage. JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga has assured residents he will not be switching off the capital's Wi-Fi indefinitely, saying he wants it to function better but legally. Soon after taking office, Msimanga announced that he would subject several contracts to thorough audits to establish if any criminality led to them being awarded. He says the Auditor General subsequently revealed that the R380 million Wi-Fi contract with Project Isizwe was awarded irregularly. Msimanga says a process to find a new contractor to replace Isizwe is now at an advanced stage. “We have no intentions of stopping or eliminating the Tshwane Wi-Fi, ours is to make it even better than it has been and that’s what we’re committing to.”
