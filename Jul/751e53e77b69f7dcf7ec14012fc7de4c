JOHANNESBURG - Brighton and Hove Albion have completed the signing of Bafana Bafana attacker Percy Tau from Mamelodi Sundowns for an undisclosed fee. The 24-year-old has agreed a four-year deal and will be loaned out ahead of the new season. Brighton manager Chris Hughton shared his thoughts on Tau and confirmed he will go out on loan for a season. “Percy is a player we have highlighted for the future, and there is no doubting his talent, having been voted South African player of the season. Percy will go out on loan this season, play regularly and get some experience of European football. We will be watching his progress and monitoring his development over the season.” Tau’s decorated Sundowns career comes to an end with multiple league titles as well as the African Champions League. Percy has made 12 international appearances for South Africa, scoring five goals, and was the PSL’s player of the season in 2017/18.    (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
