The World Cup shift is sure to come with criticism, specifically from European clubs. CAPE TOWN - Fifa president Gianni Infantino has announced that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will take place from 21 November to 18 December. This a seismic decision considering it will split the usual European football season. However, the summer heat of Qatar is considered too much of a risk. The World Cup shift is sure to come with criticism, specifically from European clubs. In recent months, Infantino has supported calls to add 16 more teams to the 2022 tournament, a plan likely to make Qatar share hosting duties because it is building only eight stadiums. Infantino hopes that sharing the matches across the Middle East region would help to ease tensions in the area.
