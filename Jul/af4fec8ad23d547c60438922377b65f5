The Urban Warriors had been relegated to the National First Division when they have docked points for illegally fielding Zimbabwean striker Tendai Ndoro. JOHANNESBURG - The Premier Soccer League will consult its advising committee in the court ruling made by Judge Denise Fisher in the Johannesburg High Court on Monday that set aside the ruling arbiter Advocate William Mokhari made in Ajax Cape Town’s docking of points which relegated them from the PSL to the NFD. The Urban Warriors had been relegated to the National First Division when they have docked points for illegally fielding Zimbabwean striker Tendai Ndoro. The ruling restores Ajax Cape Town’s points and replaces them back to a 15th position on the PSL log and out of the automatic relegation places, which also means that Amazulu, who were pushed out of the top eight return and SuperSport United drop down to 11th place. The ruling also puts a spanner in the PSL’s works as it might be forced to replay the promotion/relegation play-offs which Black Leopards won or expand the league to 18 teams with four dropping out at the end of next season. In a statement, the PSL said that they noted the ruling made by Judge Fisher and that the league’s advisors will advise the executive committee before they take any action. “Judge Fisher set aside Advocate Mokhari’s award but declined to hand down the other relief sought. It is necessary for the league to properly consider the meaning and effect of the judgment before making any further comment on the matter. The judgment and advice of the league’s advisers will be considered by the PSL executive committee and the appropriate steps will be taken in due course.”
