Proteas coach Otis Gibson says the tour match was important to get the bowlers in the swing of things after a lengthy layoff. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas coach Otis Gibson says that his team ticked the boxes they wanted to tick in the two-day tour game against a Sri Lanka Board XI that concluded on Sunday. The Proteas are in Sri Lanka for a two-Test, five ODIs and a single T20 International tour that starts with the first Test at the Galle International Stadium on Thursday, 12 July. The drawn warm-up match provided some much-needed time out in the middle for the players who have had very little international cricket since the conclusion of the historic Test series victory over Australia in March. Gibson says the tour match was important to get the bowlers in the swing of things after a lengthy layoff. “It was important for the bowlers to get some miles in the legs again, especially the fast bowlers. Dale Steyn has been playing in England but still needs some more overs under his belt and Kagiso Rabada is coming back from an injury. “I thought the guys bowled well on Saturday and for the most part, we got what we wanted. Shamsi bowled really well and has really hit the ground running and has put his hand up for a Test place.” Shamsi did impress when he took figures of 5/45 and could well partner with Keshav Maharaj as the second specialist spinner in the team for the first Test. Perhaps the department where a lot of eyes will be on is the batting, where the South Africans haven’t fared too well in the past. Captain Faf du Plessis led well with the bat, top-scoring with 79, while there were notable contributions from Hashim Amla (78) Dean Elgar (43) and Temba Bavuma (58) before a lower-order collapse led to the team being dismissed for 338. The Proteas travel to Galle on Monday where they will continue their preparations ahead of the first Test on Thursday.
