In a statement sent out by Rugby Africa, they have issued an apology to Zimbabwe Rugby and an alternative accommodation had been arranged for the team. JOHANNESBURG - The Zimbabwe National rugby team has reportedly been forced to sleep on the streets of north African country Tunisia after their accommodation was allegedly in poor condition and a lack of funds from the Zimbabwe Rugby Union. Pictures of former Springbok coach Pieter de Villiersâ€™ team sleeping in the streets surfaced on social media on Tuesday morning ahead of their Rugby World Cup Qualifier match against Tunisia this coming weekend. In a statement sent out by Rugby Africa, they have issued an apology to Zimbabwe Rugby and an alternative accommodation had been arranged for the team. "We would like to reassure the Zimbabwean Ministry of Sports, Zimbabwe Rugby Union, and all partners and fans that the situation was addressed immediately, and an acceptable solution has been found this morning. Tunisia Rugby Union took the Sables management to visit another hotel which was accepted," the statement read. "Rugby Africa and Tunisia Rugby Union would like to express their sincere apologies to the Sables team and management for this unfortunate situation. This does not reflect the standards of the Rugby Africa Gold Cup competition and we sincerely regret any prejudice caused."
