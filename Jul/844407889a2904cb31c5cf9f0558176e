LONDON - The British Cabinet is meeting in secret to discuss a plan which will decide what trade deal to offer the European Union (EU) in the Brexit  negotiations. With the first two suggestions already considered unworkable, British Prime Minister Theresa May says her Cabinet has "a great opportunity and a duty" to agree on a third option for the UK's future relationship with the EU.

The aim is to achieve trade, without tariffs or barriers, but how best to secure that is subject of huge disagreement. After months of planning and quarrels, May has called the Cabinet to a meeting to agree on a proposal on how future relations should work. Once ministers reach an agreement, the EU can then choose to accept or reject the plan. Brexiteers say itâ€™s vital the UK is able to strike trade deals with countries like South Africa independently without having to comply with EU rules. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
