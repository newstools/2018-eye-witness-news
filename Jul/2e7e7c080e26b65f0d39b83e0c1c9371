England are found wanting in midfield experience. 22-year old Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard will be up against the experienced, composed Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic. France will be waiting with bated breath on Wednesday evening to find out who they will be facing in the World Cup final come Sunday. Les Bleus beat Belgium on Tuesday evening to book their place in the final. England and Croatia do battle on Wednesday evening for the second spot in the World Cup final. Croatia’s goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic goes into the game with just one clean sheet to his name. He earned that one in Croatia’s 3-0 win over Argentina. Meanwhile, Jordan Pickford has earned two clean sheets, making ten saves since the start of the World Cup, compared to Subasic’s 12. The Croatian's save rate is far more impressive at 80%, with Pickford saving just over 70% of the shots directed at his goals. Pickford’s long passing accuracy will be a problem for Dejan Lovren who will be dealing with Harry Kane. England are found wanting in midfield experience. Dele Alli (22) and Jesse Lingard (25) will be up against the experienced, composed Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic. Modric has completed 304 passes so far, compared to Lingard's 140 and Alli’s 75. Rakitic’s work in midfield should not go unnoticed, as the Barcelona man has completed more than 230 passes in his five appearances. Lingard and Alli will need to use their energy and youth in the hope of outrunning their counterparts who have more experience and, arguably, more skill. Up front, England have all the bragging rights and confidence. Harry Kane has scored six goals from his six attempts that were on target. Mario Mandzukic has been under the radar, having only scored one and assisted one. Given the power of the Croatian midfield, 32-year-old Mandzukic can be forgiven for slightly lackluster figures.
