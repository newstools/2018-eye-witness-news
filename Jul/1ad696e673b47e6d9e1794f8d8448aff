Thabang Moroe had been acting as CEO since the departure of Haroon Lorgat in September 2017 after the failure to launch the complex lucrative domestic T20 competition in November last year. JOHANNESBURG - In his first press address since being appointed as permanent Cricket South Africa chief executive, Thabang Moroe, says that he will meet with the previous Global League T20 owners in the next two weeks. Moroe had been acting as CEO since the departure of Haroon Lorgat in September 2017 after the failure to launch the complex lucrative domestic T20 competition in November last year. The GLT20 has been top of Moroe’s priority list since his acting role and CSA and SuperSport announced earlier this year that the new revamped version of the tournament will be in partnership and will relaunch again in the summer. Despite the tournament being back on its feet, the previous franchise owners have been vehement in their condemnation of CSA’s handling of the issue in recent weeks. The franchise owners have accused CSA of trying to keep them from the new tournament and a lack of transparency to the point of threatening legal action against CSA. Moroe admitted that communication between CSA and the owners hasn’t been great but has plans to meet with the owners in the next two weeks. “We have sent communication to the owners in the form of writing, predominantly trying to set a date for us to meet as they are spread out in different parts of the world. There is an intention to meet with some of the owners in the next two weeks in Dubai. And there is also a possibility to fly over to Mumbai to meet with the other owners so that we can speak about the league and the way forward.” Moroe has been contracted on a three-year deal and will oversee the development of Cricket South Africa as a business.
