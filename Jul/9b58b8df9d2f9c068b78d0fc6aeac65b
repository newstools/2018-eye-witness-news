The Sub-Continent presents tough batting conditions, ones that Faf Du Plessis says that they relish as a team to test themselves in all conditions. JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas jetted off to Sri Lanka on Sunday evening ahead of a two-Test, five ODI and one T20 International match tour, in which Captain Faf du Plessis said it was going to be important for them to acclimatise to the Sub-Continental conditions as quickly as possible. Du Plessis and his men return to Sri Lanka having tasted victory in the Island country before, winning the two-Test series 1-0 in 2014. Though the South Africans have had the better of Sri Lanka in home conditions since then, they know that they will come against it when they travel to Sri Lanka. The Proteas have the benefit of a two-day warm-up game on 7 and 8 July ahead of the first Test match at the Galle International Stadium starting on 12 July. Du Plessis says it is going to be important for them to acclimatise. “We have had a nice break now, but we arrive about 10 days before the start of the series which will give us good time to acclimatise to the heat there.” He also believes that they have had a good preseason training period in the country. “The boys have really worked hard in the offseason at the High-Performance Centre in Pretoria and there has been really good feedback from the various coaches on the improvement of all the young batsmen.” The Sub-Continent presents tough batting conditions, ones that Du Plessis says that they relish as a team to test themselves in all conditions. “The Sub-Continent is always a tough place to tour and I am sure they are going to prepare the pitches as dry as possible so that their spinners come into the game. We as a team always want to test ourselves in tough conditions and I think this will be another great challenge for us.”
