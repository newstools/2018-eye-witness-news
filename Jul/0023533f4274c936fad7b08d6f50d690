JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN – As Kevin Anderson secures South Africa’s first shot at a Wimbledon final in more than 30 years, the Sports Minister has congratulated him for his stunning win. Tokozile Xasa hailed Anderson as a true ambassador of the country after he pulled off one of Wimbledon’s biggest upsets on Wednesday, beating Roger Federer to advance to the semifinals. The South African showed astonishing grit as he fought and won an epic battle with the defending champion. The match went to five sets and lasted four hours. Anderson becomes the first South African since Kevin Curran in 1983 to reach the Wimbledon semifinals. Federer took the first two sets but Anderson showed amazing resolve to fight back and win the third and fourth set. The South African held his nerve to win a marathon fifth set 13-11 to secure his spot in the semi-finals with the result sending shockwaves around the world. No South African has ever won Wimbledon, Curran was a runner up in 1985, while Wayne Ferreira made the quarterfinals in 1994. Anderson’s feat will remembered as one of the most astonishing upsets on grass and a defining day for the 32-year-old's career. (edited by Leeto M Khoza)
