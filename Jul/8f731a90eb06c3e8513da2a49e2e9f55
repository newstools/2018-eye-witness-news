PRETORIA - Home Affairs offices across the country are scheduled to undergo an upgrade as part of the department’s modernisation programme towards a completely paperless system. Minister Malusi Gigaba has announced plans in Pretoria for the upgrade which will cover birth, marriage and death registrations. Gigaba has described the plans to upgrade systems as another way the department is “meeting the future”. He says the new live capture system will streamline the application process for birth, marriage and death certificates, as well as the way they’re issued. “The end product will be the automation of the way Home Affairs offices capture birth registration and issue certificates for birth, marriages and deaths. Documents will now be saved electronically and be easily retrieved upon request.”  Minimal interruptions for Smart ID and passport services are expected at various offices across the country during the upgrade from 13 to 20 July, but users may visit large offices in their province which will not be affected.
