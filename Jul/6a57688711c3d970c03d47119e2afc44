Over the past five years, Burberry has destroyed £90 million worth of goods. LONDON - Environmental campaigners have criticised British fashion label Burberry for destroying unsold clothes and accessories worth R450 million last year to protect its brand. Fashion houses often destroy unwanted items to prevent them being sold cheaply or stolen. The upmarket firm has been battling to maintain its exclusive brand. Counterfeiters have focused on Burberry and others, to produce inferior copies of the products at a fraction of the price. Over the past five years, Burberry has destroyed £90 million worth of goods. This year, clothes, accessories and perfumes were destroyed by fire. The firm says that energy generated from the fire was captured to make it environmentally friendly. And it seems it's not just Burberry which destroys unsold goods. After offering leftover merchandise to its staff at a discounted rate, Louis Vuitton is also said to burn goods in order to maintain the label’s exclusivity and avoid selling them at a lower price. But many green campaigners say that the destruction of the goods is the fashion industry's dirty little secret and a terrible waste.
