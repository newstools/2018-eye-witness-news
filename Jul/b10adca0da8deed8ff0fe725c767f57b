Diplomats from every country except the US negotiated as global tensions on the issue continue to cause political upheaval and harsh anti-immigrant sentiment. JOHANNESBURG - The United Nations General Assembly has agreed on a deal to better manage the international flow of migrants and protect human rights. Diplomats from every country except the US negotiated as global tensions on the issue continue to cause political upheaval and harsh anti-immigrant sentiment. Known as the Global Compact for Migration, the deal will be formally adopted by world leaders in Morocco this December. United Nations Special Representative for International Migration Louise Arbour says the deal will be good if it’s well implemented. “It preserves state sovereignty and their rights to decide their migration policies. It will reduce the chaos of irregular, dangerous migration. It will increase access to safe, legal pathways, for instance to the labour market that has a deficit in human resources.”
