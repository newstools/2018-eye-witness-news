Protesters, activists and Internet users are seeking to influence Google’s algorithm so that when the term 'idiot' is searched for, images of Trump pop up on Google. JOHANNESBURG - When you type the word 'idiot' into Google’s image search, guess what result comes up first? Images of none other than US President Donald Trump!   This is partly because the Green Day song American Idiot was used by protesters to soundtrack his trip to London. Protesters, activists and Internet users are seeking to influence Google’s algorithm so that when the term 'idiot' is searched for, images of Trump pop up on Google. But why is this image the first one in the search results? The explanation is simple. When you type a keyword on Google images, it shows up photos that have meta tags as that particular keyword. So it means that thousands of people have uploaded images of Trump with 'idiot' as a tag.
