Blok Developers claim the protesters are intimidating workers and putting them in danger. CAPE TOWN - A property developer wants the court to interdict Bo-Kaap residents from demonstrating near a construction site. Blok Developers claim the protesters are intimidating workers and putting them in danger. The Bo-Kaap Civic Association is opposing the development because it feels the building would destroy the historical feel of the Bo-Kaap. Association secretary Jacqueline Poking says it will state its case in court, but she has explained that the development is not the only battle it's fighting. “The Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association and the community of Bo-Kaap have been protesting for months now, with regards to the care and rates in our area, how it’s affecting our community which is a poor community. People have lived for generation within their homes and they’re basically being taxed out of it.”  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
