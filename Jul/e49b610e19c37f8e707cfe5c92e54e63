Dumezweni Mmusi from the Traditional Healers Organisation says she’s struggled for years to secure land so she can plant her herbs and to consult with her patients. JOHANNESBURG - Traditional healers have told Parliament's review committee they're being exploited by the pharmaceutical industry which they supply herbs to. Land hearings have entered the second day in Gauteng, this time in Sedibeng. Members of the public are making submissions on whether to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to expropriate land without compensation. Dumezweni Mmusi from the Traditional Healers Organisation says she’s struggled for years to secure land so she can plant her herbs and to consult with her patients. She says traditional healers are forced to assist pharmacists with herbs for income. Mmusi says if she and her colleagues were given land, they could avoid exploitation and make a living for their families. ANCESTRAL LAND AND GRAVES Ancestral land and space for graveyards have formed the focus of land hearings in the Vaal on Friday. Parliament’s review committee has heard how people in the Vaal and on the East Rand struggle to bury their dead as they cannot afford to buy space in graveyards. A woman says her parents were buried in their backyard, but her family was moved by developers. “As I stand here, I do not know my father’s grave. When they arrived, they just started digging and they kicked my family out. When we returned and asked to see the grave, they refused.” She says with the help of her political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, her family was able to gain access to the land and tried to exhume the remains, but they found nothing. Residents have asked that government allocate them portions of residential land to allow for burials. (Edited by Winnie Theletsane)
