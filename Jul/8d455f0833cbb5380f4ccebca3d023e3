Anderson is one of two semi-finalists and one finalist to carry South African dreams at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. CAPE TOWN - South African Kevin Anderson is playing his first Wimbledon semifinal on Friday afternoon. He is up against John Isner form the United States. Anderson is one of two semifinalists and one finalist to carry South African dreams at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. South African tennis players are travelling into new territory this year. Firstly, Anderson will contest his first Wimbledon semifinal. It’s also the first time in over 30 years that a South African has got this far in the men’s draw. The lanky Anderson took out the 8-time Wimbledon champion and legend Roger Federer in one of the most astonishing upsets, in a match that lasted over four hours. Flying under the radar though is Raven Klaasen, the 35-year-old Cape Town native, who along with his partner Michael Venus, fought their way into the men’s doubles finals for the first time. Klaasen is in search of his maiden Grand Slam title on Saturday when he comes up against the seventh seeded American pair of Mike Bryan and Jack Sock. Meanwhile, wheelchair tennis veteran Kgothatso Montjane became the first black South African woman to compete at Wimbledon. The 32-year-old Montjane who received a wildcard entry is into the semifinals of her draw and she’ll face the number one seed on Friday. Whatever the results are, it’s certainly been the nation’s best performance at the iconic tournament in recent memory that has raised the profile of South African tennis.
