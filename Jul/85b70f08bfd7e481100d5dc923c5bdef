It’s understood her body was found in a shallow stream in Siyabuswa on Thursday. Police say they suspect the young girl may have been raped. Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi says, “The girl has been found, however, we’re so sad as the community of Mpumalanga that she was found dead.
