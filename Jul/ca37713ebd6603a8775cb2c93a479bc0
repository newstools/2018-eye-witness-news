In its quarterly labour force survey, Statistics South Africa says that the manufacturing sector saw the most job losses. JOHANNESBURG - It has emerged that South Africa's unemployment rate rose to 27.2% of the labour force in the second quarter from 26.7% in the first three months of this year. In its quarterly labour force survey, Statistics South Africa says that the manufacturing sector saw the most job losses. There were 6.1 million people without jobs in the three months to the end of June, compared with 6 million in the previous quarter. Economist Kevin Lings: "The South African economy has been under pressure during the course of this year. We had a particularly bad first quarter GDP. The data has improved a little bit in the second quarter but it remains fairly weak overall and under those conditions, companies are simply not adding significant numbers of jobs."
