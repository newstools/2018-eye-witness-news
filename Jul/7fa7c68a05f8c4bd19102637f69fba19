The independent Judicial Commissioner Michael Beloff on Monday handed Dinesh Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha eight suspension points. JOHANNESBURG - Sri Lankan cricket captain Dinesh Chandimal has been suspended by the ICC for two Test matches and four ODI’s for breaching the ICC’s Code of Conduct during the Test series against the West Indies last month. The independent Judicial Commissioner, Michael Beloff, on Monday handed Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha eight suspension points, which means the trio have also been suspended for the first four ODIs along with both the Tests against South Africa. The three were charged by the ICC chief executive David Richardson on 19 June and had pleaded guilty to breaching Level 3, Article 2.3.1, which relates to “conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game”, during last month’s St Lucia Test against the West Indies. The charge comes after Chandimal was reported to the match referee for ball tampering after he was caught shining the ball with saliva that had come into contact with an artificial substance. Chandimal, Hathurusinghe and Gurusinha then refused to come out of their changing room for the start of play in the next session causing the trio to be charged by Richardson.
