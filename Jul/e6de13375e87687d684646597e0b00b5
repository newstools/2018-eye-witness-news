The DA's city caucus was under instruction from its Federal Executive to withdraw the notice, but councillors appeared to be split on whether to toe the line. CAPE TOWN - A notice to table a motion of no confidence in Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has officially been withdrawn. It follows a directive from the Democratic Alliance (DA)'s federal executive  on Thursday morning, that the notice be withdrawn. Councillor Marian Nieuwoudt who gave notice of the motion said it had been brought to her attention that there are other channels that can bring a solution to the situation involving De Lille. She did not elaborate on what these channels are before withdrawing the notice. But in a statement released shortly afterwards, the DA said De Lille would now be subjected to a disciplinary process that will take place over three days in August. Upon De Lille's insistence, the prosecution against her will be led by an independent senior prosecutor and will be open to the media. The DA's Solly Malatsi said: “The secondary hearing will take place during the course of August over three days. It will also be led by an independent senior prosecutor. It will be open to the public and media.”  Earlier EWN reported that the DA's city caucus was under instruction from its Federal Executive to withdraw the notice, but councillors appeared to be split on whether to toe the line. There had been fierce behind the scenes lobbying around whether to go ahead with a motion of no confidence in De Lille as a full council meeting proceeded to deal with the business of the City.
