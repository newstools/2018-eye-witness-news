The Gauteng ANC has described those gatherings as successful and incident-free, calling Tshwane and the West Rand to emulate them. The remaining regions are expected to conclude their conferences on Sunday which paves the way for the provincial conference to take place. The province’s 13th conference will be held in two weeks time and it’s expected to be hotly contested. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
