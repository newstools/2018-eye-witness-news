Would or wouldn't? Claims by the US President that he misspoke in a comment about Russian meddling in US elections has Twitter in a frenzy. JOHANNESBURG – US President Donald Trump’s attempt to go back on remarks made in Finland, saying he saw no reason to believe that Russia had interfered in the 2016 US elections, has been received with amusement on Twitter. Trump said that when he returned on Monday from the summit with Putin in Helsinki, he "realised there is some need for clarification" about his remarks on Russian interference in the 2016 US election. “In a key sentence in my remarks I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't'. The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia,'" he said. "Sort of a double negative.”  The hashtags #would and #wouldnt trended on Twitter as people suggested other ways Trump’s “double negative” defence could be employed.
