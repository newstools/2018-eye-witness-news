Eben Etzebeth who captained the Springboks last year has been out of action for the last six months. JOHANNESBURG - Stormers and Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth is still recovering from a back and nerve injury and is not yet fit to return to action for the Stormers in Super Rugby. Etzebeth who captained the Springboks last year has been out of action for the last six months and has not played a single game for the Stormers in this year’s Super Rugby competition as well as the Springboks’ 2-1 Test series victory over England last month. The cape side do have some good news as hooker Scarra Ntubeni and lock JD Schickerling will be available for selection against the Sharks at Newlands on Saturday. Both players featured for Western Province in the SuperSport Rugby Challenge on Sunday on their return from injury. Scrumhalf Justin Phillips is battling a rib injury and will be assessed in the week to determine if he is fit to play. The Stormers will also be without fullback SP Marais, who has a quad injury. The other players on the long-term injury list are Jaco Coetzee (repeated concussion), Seabelo Senatla (groin) and Dan du Plessis (knee) - whose return will be determined by how their recovery progresses.
