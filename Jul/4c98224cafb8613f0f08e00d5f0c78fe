The boy is part of a group who went into the Tham Luang cave more than two weeks ago. They became trapped in the cave after heavy rain flooded the passageways inside. JOHANNESBURG - The eighth boy has now emerged from the cave where a soccer team and their coach have been trapped in Thailand. The group went into the Tham Luang cave more than two weeks ago. They became trapped in the cave after heavy rain flooded the passageways inside. The rescue operation was launched on Sunday and four boys were brought out that day. The dangerous bid to rescue the boys - aged between 11 and 16 - got going again hours earlier on Monday after a break to replenish oxygen supplies and make other preparations deep inside the cave complex in northern Thailandâ€™s Chiang Rai province. Authorities have said the mission could take three or four days to complete. It is a race against the clock with heavy rain expected in coming days, which would again dangerously flood the tunnels.
