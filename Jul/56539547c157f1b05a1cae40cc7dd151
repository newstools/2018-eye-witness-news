Max, who is a provincial legislature member for the DA, is expected to hold a press conference tomorrow to discuss the move. CAPE TOWN - DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela says there's no need to meet member of the legislature Lennit Max following his decision to take up a job in the police ministry. He has been appointed as special advisor to police minister Bheki Cele. Max, who is a provincial legislature member for the DA, is expected to hold a press conference tomorrow to discuss the move. Madikizela says he hasn't received official communication from him that he's resigning from the party but he says it's only a matter of time. The Western Cape leader says if he wants to leave the DA he won't try to stop him. "Why would I bother trying to convince someone who's already made up his mind? I mean, you take your leaders into your confidence about things like this and communicate with them prior to making the decision. Not because they are going to stop you, but I mean it's a courtesy. Now if he doesn't see the need for him to do that, why should I bother?" Max was the Western Cape's provincial police commissioner from 1999 to 2003. Cele's spokesperson has not yet responded to EWN for comment.
