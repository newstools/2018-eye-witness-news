Protesters claim that the Overstrand municipality has been dragging its feet in securing land for affordable housing, but officials say that the processes are at an advanced stage.

The group also wants Cele to release other community leaders who've been arrested, but the minister says he can't do that. “They are with the prosecution and what I’ve requested them is that the police will still be talking to them and we’ll see if we can’t oppose bail.” The minister says he will contact the Human Settlements Department to address residents' concerns over land and housing.
