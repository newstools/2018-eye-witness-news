Efstathiou specified the three legal steps, which include an interdict to the new season the Urban Warriors would take in order to save their Premier League status. CAPE TOWN - Ajax Cape Town CEO Ari Efstathiou indicated that the club will continue their fight as the Tendai Ndoro  saga continues to play out and possibly delay the league season in August. Efstathiou specified the three legal steps, which include an interdict to the new season the Urban Warriors would take in order to save their Premier League status. “We will oppose the action for leave to appeal, but we are concerned that the application is unlikely to be heard before the new season.” This means Ajax are hoping to halt the PSL’s appeal of Judge Denise Fischer’s ruling which set aside Safa arbitrator William Mokhari’s punishment, Fischer’s ruling saw Ajax should regain their PSL status, but the High Court is currently in recess until 31 July. If the High Court agrees to hear the PSL’s appeal, Efstathiou then described a second application which will run simultaneously with the first which they’ve put forward. If successful, Fischer’s decision to reinstate Ajax into the league would be applicable instantly. "Ajax will launch an application to ask that Judge Fischer's decision would be immediately effective if a (PSL) appeal is heard.” Thirdly, and probably the most important aspect of Ajax’s strategy considering the PSL’s determination to start the league on time, Efstathiou confirmed they will seek an urgent court interdict to the start of the season. "We have no other choice but to throw everything at it.," Efstathiou said.
