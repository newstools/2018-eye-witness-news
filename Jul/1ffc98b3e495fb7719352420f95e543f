Daniels was found guilty on all four charges related to her involvement in the McKinsey, Trillian and Tegeta transactions as well as the distribution of confidential information. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  has confirmed that suspended head of legal and compliance Suzanne Daniels has been dismissed. Independent chair of her disciplinary hearing Advocate Nazir Cassim has found Daniels committed serious misconduct and that she breached her duties of good faith, trust and confidence. Daniels was found guilty on all four charges related to her involvement in the McKinsey, Trillian, and Tegeta transactions as well as the distribution of confidential information. These transactions have also been probed by a parliamentary inquiry into state capture at which Daniels also testified last year. The disciplinary hearing found that she had also distributed confidential information to a third party. Eskom's Khulu Phasiwe said: “It was found that she had distributed confidential information that belongs to the company and also, she was caught in the McKinsey-Trillian transaction, also her involvement in the Tegeta transaction. Ultimately, she was also found to have made payments from Eskom to a case which had nothing to do with Eskom.” Daniels had been on suspension with full pay since March.
