JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s Kevin Anderson has beaten defending Wimbledon champion Roger Federer in five gruelling sets. Anderson took it 2-6, 6-7, 7-5, 6-4, 13-11. Federer took the first two sets and then the South African returned strongly to take the third and fourth sets. The two players then held their serves brilliantly in the fifth and decisive set, until Anderson broke Federer in the 23rd game to go up 12-11. Anderson then held the 24th game to clinch one of tennis’ most famous victories. It's Anderson’s very first time in the Wimbledon semi-finals and he will now face either Milos Raonic or John Isner for a place in the final. This feat follows Anderson’s 2015 battle with Novak Djokovic, where he took the Serb to five sets in the Wimbledon round of 16 in 2015.
