WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that talks with North Korea were “going well” as US officials seek to reach an agreement with Pyongyang over a denuclearisation plan following last month’s summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The White House has characterised ongoing meetings as positive but not commented on recent news reports of US intelligence assessments saying North Korea has been expanding its weapons capabilities. In a Twitter post, Trump said that North Korea has conducted “no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months.”  On Monday, the White House said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would travel to North Korea this week to continue talks on denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. A US delegation met over the weekend with North Korean counterparts at the border between North and South Korea to discuss the next steps to implementing the June 12 summit’s declaration, according to the US State Department. “Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!” Trump said in his Twitter post, echoing his sentiments following the historic meeting with Kim in Singapore.
