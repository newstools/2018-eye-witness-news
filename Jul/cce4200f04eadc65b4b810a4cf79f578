A police officer was viciously assaulted by protesters in the volatile community on Thursday night. CAPE TOWN - Police Minister Bheki Cele has instructed police to find the missing firearm stolen from an officer in Zwelihle. Cele is in the area on Friday to quell the tensions that have been raging for more than a week. A police officer was viciously assaulted by protesters in the volatile community on Thursday night. The officer is recovering in hospital. One suspect has been arrested. He was found with a police service shotgun and ammunition. Violence erupted again in the area hours after a community activist appeared in court. But Cele has urged officers in Hermanus to find the missing 9mm firearm immediately. “We are here to establish the authority of the state.” Cele has met with Hermanus community leaders, business people and officers in the municipal auditorium ahead of a meeting with Zwelihle residents later in the area. Other officials who are there on Friday include Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula, the Human Rights Commission’s Chris Nissen and Parliament police committee’s Leonard Ramatlakane.
