The KFC ad could be making fun of a lot of soccer players but Neymar has undoubtedly drawn the most conversation for his antics on the pitch. JOHANNESBURG â€“ Who will win the 2018 Soccer World Cup? Is it England, Belgium or is it Brazil? The World Cup has been on everyoneâ€™s lips lately but itâ€™s Neymar's elaborate diving, rolling and flopping that has been dominating conversations. Brazilâ€™s superstar has spent plenty of time on the ground writhing in agony, some warranted and some maybe not so much. At the start of the tournament in In June, KFC South Africa released a funny advertisement depicting a soccer player being tackled then dramatically falling to the ground and holding on to his knee.  The player then starts throwing up his hands, flopping and rolling ... until he gets to a KFC! At the same time, Twitter has come up with the hashtag #NeymarChallenge where different gifs and memes have been shared. #Copa2018 pic.twitter.com/aakpU9wRrN  ðŸ˜‚ Why yâ€™all do Neymar like that? pic.twitter.com/5DtE3sjhtn  TF ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Neymar outchea rolling  #NeymarChallenge pic.twitter.com/IOvkfLWnWx  This had me dying ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ #NeymarChallenge pic.twitter.com/upmyZAontx  How @neymarjr act in real life ðŸ˜‚The real #NeymarChallenge pic.twitter.com/W1alwrUtCn
