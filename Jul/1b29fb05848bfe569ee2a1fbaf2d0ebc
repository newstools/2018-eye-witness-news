Over 2,000 children remain separated from their parents despite Donald Trump overturning the policy that split up families of people arrested at the Mexican American border. NEW YORK – Protests took place across the US this weekend over Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies. Over 2,000 children remain separated from their parents despite President Donald Trump overturning the policy that split up families of people arrested at the Mexican-American border. Celebrities like Alicia Keys and America Ferrera, who both happen to be mothers, spoke at a protest in Washington DC, calling for migrant families split at the border to be reunited. There are concerns that records were not kept linking parents and children. In cities like Los Angeles and New York, thousands of people marched with some holding placards calling for no more family separations and for the abolishment of the immigration agency ICE.
