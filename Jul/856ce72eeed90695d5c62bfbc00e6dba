Samuel Umtiti’s headed goal in the 51st minute was enough to send France through to the World Cup final in Moscow on Sunday. The first finalist of the 2018 FIFA World Cup has been confirmed following France’s 1-0 victory over Belgium on Tuesday night in Saint Petersburg. The teams went into the break goalless with Kylian Mbappe making a number of threatening runs against the Belgian defence. The Red Devils threatened as well, with a number of chances on offer on the left wing for Eden Hazard. Samuel Umtiti opened the scoring with a header at the near post after beating Marouane Fellaini - his goal sending fans in the stadium, and around the world, into a frenzy. Belgium threatened but could not break down a stoic France midfield and defence made up of Ngolo Kante, Raphael Varane and, scorer, Umtiti. As the Belgians pushed forward, France were offered a number of chances to double the lead and seal their place in the final, but could not add to their 1-0 advantage. France will face, either, England or Croatia in the final. They face each other on Wednesday evening.
