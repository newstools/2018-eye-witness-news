Ajax CEO Ari Efstathiou indicated last week that the club would continue their protracted fight as the Tendai Ndoro saga continues with no clear ending in sight. CAPE TOWN - Ajax Cape Town will on Tuesday 24 July return to the South Gauteng High Court to apply to interdict the start of the 2018-19 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season. Ajax CEO Ari Efstathiou indicated last week that the club would continue their protracted fight as the Tendai Ndoro saga continues with no clear ending in sight. Efstathiou specified the three legal steps, which includes an interdict to the new season as the Urban Warriors fight for their PSL status “We will oppose the action for leave to appeal, but we are concerned that the application is unlikely to be heard before the new season.” This means Ajax are hoping to halt the PSL’s appeal of Judge Denise Fischer’s ruling which set aside Safa arbitrator William Mokhari’s punishment, Fischer’s ruling saw Ajax should regain their PSL status. If the High Court agrees to hear the PSL’s appeal, Efstathiou then described a second application which will run simultaneously with the first. If successful, Fischer’s decision to reinstate Ajax into the league would be applicable instantly. "Ajax will launch an application to ask that Judge Fischer's decision would be immediately effective if a (PSL) appeal is heard.” Thirdly, and probably the most important aspect of Ajax’s strategy considering the PSL’s determination to start the league on time, Efstathiou confirmed the interdict application which will be filed in court next Tuesday. "We have no other choice but to throw everything at it," Efstathiou said. The PSL season is set to begin on 3 August, but, doubts remain if it will go ahead as planned considering the amount of court battles on the go concurrently regarding the Ndoro matter.
