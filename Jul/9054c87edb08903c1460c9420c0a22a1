CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town's road repair teams are busy inspecting and filling potholes caused by heavy rainfall so far this winter. The municipality says it's received more than 2,000 reports of potholes across the mother city from the first of June until this week alone. During the same period last year, only 859 potholes were logged. City councillor Brett Herron said: “The road repair teams are being dispatched to inspect and repair potholes. And residents need to keep in mind that due to practical reasons, especially in winter, we often do temporary repairs of potholes as the holding action until more favourable drier conditions allow for more permanent repair.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
