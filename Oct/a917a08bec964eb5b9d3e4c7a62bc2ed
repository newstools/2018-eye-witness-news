The ANC national chairperson warned those who took part in the R2 billion looting of the Limpopo-based mutual bank have nowhere to hide. POLOKWANE – African National Congress (ANC) national chairperson Gwede Mantashe says leaders who’re implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank corruption scandal must confess their alleged wrongdoing. Mantashe addressed the party’s people’s manifesto forum in Polokwane on Saturday. He’s warned those who took part in the R2 billion looting of the Limpopo-based mutual bank have nowhere to hide. The names of ANC Limpopo deputy chairperson and mayor of the Vhembe District Municipality Florence Radzilani and provincial treasurer Danny Msiza were mentioned in the report as part of those who contributed to the collapse of VBS. Mantashe says an investigation similar to the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will be instituted to hold those who had their hands in the cookie jar accountable. “One should stand up and own up after committing a mistake.” The ANC says it has written to its Integrity Commission, a virtually powerless unit that’s headed by veteran politician and former Robben Island prisoner George Mashamba, to investigate the conduct of its leaders implicated in the VBS corruption scandal. The governing party’s top six national officials were set to meet with Limpopo’s five officials over the VBS matter. Meanwhile, Msiza is challenging Advocate Terry Motau's VBS Bank “heist” report, demanding a retraction of allegations that he took part in the R2 billion looting. Msiza has set a deadline of Monday for the retraction and is also demanding an apology. He says it was unreasonable of Motau to release a report without giving those implicated an opportunity to refute the claims. At the same time, Economic Freedom Fighters Deputy President Floyd Shivambu’s brother Brian is also taking the report on legal review at the High Court. Brian's lawyer Victor Nkwashu says his client was not given the opportunity to explain his relationship with VBS Mutual Bank before the release of the report.
