New Finance Minister Tito Mboweni clearly loves Twitter - and he's remarkably good at it for a 'pensioner'. JOHANNESBURG - Tito Mboweni waited a loooooong time to become Finance Minister, a position many felt he was destined for after serving as South African Reserve Bank governor for 10 years from 1999. Since 2009, he's been keeping himself busy with a series of business ventures, corporate gigs and ... Twitter. Mboweni clearly loves the social media platform, giving people a glimpse into his life, political thoughts and sense of humour.     In February, Mboweni tweeted that he was "not available for Minister of Finance." He added, "You cannot recycle the same people all over again. It is time for young people ... Not Cabinet. We have done that." However, in recent weeks Mboweni seemed to be changing his tune, or at the very least, reminiscing about the past.   It seems Mboweni also foresaw his new life as finance minister in August already.   Now that he's finance minister, will we see Mboweni - who has a song named after him - retreating from sharing his thoughts on Twitter?
