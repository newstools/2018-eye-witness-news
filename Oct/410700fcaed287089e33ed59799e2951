CAPE TOWN - Sharks head coach Robert du Preez  has made two changes to the team that beat the Lions last week for Saturday’s Currie Cup final against Western Province at Newlands.

In both matches we didn’t play for a full 80 minutes, we got a bit complacent. We’re focussing on the full 80, or the full 90 if that’s what it takes. “The focus is on us right now, not on Western Province, although we know it’s going to be a huge clash. They have a massive pack, we have a big pack too, so it’s the old cliché again: it will all be won up front. It will be huge. If all eight and the forwards off the bench all put up our hands, it will be good.” In the other change, young winger Aphelele Fassi replaces Lwazi Mvovo, who was concussed in last week’s match.
