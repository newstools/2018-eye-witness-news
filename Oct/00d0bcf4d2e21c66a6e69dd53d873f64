The Presidency has confirmed that Cyril Ramaphosa and Nhlanhla Nene spoke on Sunday about the implications of the finance minister’s revelations at the state capture commission. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will make a public statement at 4.30 pm on Tuesday on the developments surrounding Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene's future. Ramaphosa will address a media briefing in Cape Town. The Presidency has confirmed that Ramaphosa and Nene spoke on Sunday about the implications of the finance minister’s revelations at the state capture commission. Nene revealed last week that he visited the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home on four occasions when he was still deputy finance minister, contradicting a 2016 interview in which he said he only bumped into the family during public gatherings. Last week, he publicly apologised for lying about his interactions with the Guptas. Four days after Nene made the shocking revelations at the state capture commission and then apologised, he called President Ramaphosa. The president’s spokesperson Khusela Diko would not confirm if Nene’s future in the ministry was discussed during that phone call but she says Ramaphosa takes the discussion seriously. “He’s made a commitment that he will make a decision after the presentations that Minister Nene has made to him. In the interest of ensuring certainty in our markets, he’s committed that he’ll make an announcement quite soon on it.” Diko says Ramaphosa is cognisant that Treasury requires a finance minister who continues to enjoy the confidence of the executive.
