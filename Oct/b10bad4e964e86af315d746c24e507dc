JOHANNESBURG - The Limpopo provincial executive committee (PEC) wants municipal managers and chief financial officers of municipalities implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank scandal to be suspended. Eyewitness News has reliably learnt that this was the main decision taken at the special PEC meeting on Tuesday night in the wake of the Reserve Bank report detailing widespread looting at the bank. At least eight Limpopo municipalities illegally invested more than R1 billion into VBS, money they will now never get back. EWN has learnt from sources that attended the meeting that accounting officials including municipal managers and CFO’s from municipalities implicated must be suspended immediately. However, the highest decision-making body in the province is passing the buck on politicians, referring them to lower structures to answer on their role. The PEC decided that urgent regional executive committee meetings should be convened and mayors, chief whips and speakers be called to account for their involvement. The report implicated African National Congress Limpopo deputy chairperson Florence Radzilani who is also an executive mayor of the Vhembe District Municipality and the party’s provincial treasurer Danny Msiza. EWN understands that while there was a push by some PEC members for Msiza and Radzilani to step down, the PEC resolved that the party’s integrity commission, which will meet the two leaders next week, should decide their fate. The ANC in Limpopo has confirmed it's given its municipal deployeers a month to find who is responsible for depositing money into the scandal-plagued VBS bank. The party would also like to know who authorised those transactions. ANC Limpopo PEC spokesman Donald Selamolela says accountability is needed in the wake of the VBS scandal and those who broke the law cannot be protected. “At this stage, we’re unable to say it is so and so. Hence, we’re saying let me go before the end of this month, make a determination and tell us what are the consequent management process they’re putting in place so were able to act out of that.” Selamolela says the province expects feedback as to who was responsible and what action has been taken. At the same time, two Giyani Municipal officials including the CFO, have been suspended for their role in the VBS saga. It remains to be seen if mayors of the eight implicated municipalities will also be sanctioned.
