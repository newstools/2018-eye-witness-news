CAPE TOWN - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) says it's disappointed at the City of Cape Town’s premature attempt to deploy a new rail enforcement unit. Some members of the unit were ready for duty. Metrorail says contrary to a request from Prasa to hold back the deployment for now, the city went ahead anyway. WATCH: Cape commuters will have to wait a little longer for rail police  The rail operator's Riana Scott explains the delay. “We acknowledge that we revised and postponed the launch date. It was agreed by the three original signatories that the launch would make a fitting end to the national Department of Transport’s annual transport activities.” The longer officials wait, the more opportunities there are for criminals. But city law enforcement officers managed to foil an attempt by a group of criminals to steal copper wire near a Mitchell Plain train station. The suspects fled after they were spotted digging trenches in Lentegeur earlier this week. Copper thieves have played a massive role in crippling Metrorail train services. The much-anticipated unit is part of a broader initiative aimed at bolstering security measures at train platforms, on coaches and along railway lines. Additional reporting by Lauren Isaacs.
