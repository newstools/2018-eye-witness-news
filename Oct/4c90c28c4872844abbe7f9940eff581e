The agency has given its verdict on the budget speech, presented by the minister on Wednesday. It's concerned about expenditure on state-owned entities and has affirmed Eskom at BB-. Fitch says it has noted that Mboweni has lowered revenue projections to make them more realistic. However, it says the budget shows that the prospect of debt stabilisation has been pushed into the future and added to this, there are no significant measures to correct the overall situation.

Moody's is expected to make a pronouncement soon.
