The IFP says there is no firm deadline for when the elective conference will be held but it has timelines which have been set for when certain issues should be dealt with. DURBAN - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has announced an elective conference which was scheduled to take place next week has now been postponed until such a time that officials can vouch for the integrity of internal branch processes. The party has dismissed claims that its President Mangosuthu Buthelezi has caused the latest delay because of an alleged faction within the organisation that plans to contest his preferred successor. The IFP’s KZN secretary Velenkosini Hlabisa has been earmarked by the national council to take over from Buthelezi after he announced plans to step down. Buthelezi has been the head of the party since its inception in 1975. The IFP has had strong words for those who claim the party is battling internal divisions because of its decision to delay its elective conference. Deputy national chairperson Albert Mncwango says their priority is to uphold the integrity of the organisation’s processes which has led to the postponement. “As things stand, the delegates’ roll is incomplete.” National spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa has also been asked to respond to questions around when Prince Buthelezi will step down. “He is dutybound to see through the end of the term of office which was selected for and that term will end at the conference.” The IFP says there is no firm deadline for when the elective conference will be held but it has timelines which have been set for when certain issues should be dealt with.
