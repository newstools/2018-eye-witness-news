The intercepted packages had been intended for eight high-profile people, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. NEW YORK - Investigators are continuing to search for who is behind a series of suspected packages believed to contain explosive devices sent to several Democrats. The intercepted packages had been intended for eight high-profile people, including former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Authorities say the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been searching a mail facility near Miami; it's believed at least one of the suspected mail bombs was sent from Florida that facility. On Thursday night, the Time Warner Center - home to CNN - which received a package on Wednesday, was evacuated. But reports of a suspicious package were later declared a false alarm. Clinton, who was an intended recipient of one of the packages that were intercepted, attended a Bruce Springsteen show on Thursday night where there was added security at the venue. Police patrols have been enhanced in the city including at many of the news networks. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
