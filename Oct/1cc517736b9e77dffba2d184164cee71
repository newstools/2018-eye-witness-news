Spokesperson Thabisa Mkhwanazi says the firm relies heavily on local suppliers and is looking at options to reopen soon. Last week, the central bank downgraded local US dollar accounts, which has sent black market rates for scarce foreign currency spiralling and has also prompted panic buying. Several other firms, including some butcheries and pharmacies, have also closed shop. But others are soldiering on; popular local restaurants Maestro and Pariah State have been posting messages on social media saying they’re still open despite the challenges.
