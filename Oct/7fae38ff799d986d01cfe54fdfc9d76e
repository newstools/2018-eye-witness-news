CAPE TOWN - Tributes continue to pour in for South Africa’s most renowned open water sea swimmer Theodore Yach. Yach passed away on Wednesday. He was undergoing routine tests for an asthma complaint when he collapsed and died in hospital. He was a veteran of 108 Robben Island swims and an English Channel swim among other achievements. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille says: “He was one of the most generous, warm, open-hearted and community giving people I’ve known. And also, so young and so fit. He didn’t drink or smoke. He was the epitome of someone who lived a healthy life.”
