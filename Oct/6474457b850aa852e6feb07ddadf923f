The former Member of Parliament and South African ambassador to Germany and Zambia died at the age of 69 earlier this month. Makhura says Chikane's passing has deeply affected him. “We are orphaned by this untimely departure of a mentor, a teacher, a leader. Once more death has struck like a thunderbolt, leaving the Chikane family and the entire ANC and the alliance in deep pain.” (Edited by Refilwe Thobega)
