The family has laid a wreath in remembrance of Sisulu on Sunday morning. JOHANNESBURG - Archbishop Thabo Makgoba has urged South Africans to continue the legacy of Albertina Sisulu. Makgoba was speaking at the official thanksgiving service commemorating what would have been the 100th birthday of the struggle stalwart on Sunday. Sisulu was a powerful political figure in the 1950s, championing women's rights during apartheid. Makgoba says society must continue the struggle. “I believe it must be, to be must be of service to God’s people and our nation. It must be to join the new struggle with the same passion and conviction as Mama Sisulu had for the struggle against apartheid.” The stalwart's granddaughter Zoya Sisulu says the celebration is to acknowledge a great woman. “For me, it’s important because I don’t think we often celebrate women in this manner. We don’t often take the time to pause, step back and actually acknowledge what it is that they’ve contributed and their part in the struggle.”
