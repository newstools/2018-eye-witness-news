Investors remained skittish as Africa’s most industrialised economy struggles with ballooning debt that risks pushing its sovereign credit ratings deeper into ‘junk’ territory. JOHANNESBURG - The rand fell more than one percent and bonds slid on Wednesday after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni delivered a medium-term budget with wider deficit estimates and lower growth forecasts. At 15.33 GMT, the rand traded at 14.4975 versus the dollar, 1.65% weaker on the day, compared to a close of 14.2625 in New York. Government bonds were also weaker, with the yield on the benchmark instrument due in 2026 up 6.5 basis points at 9.230%. Mboweni earlier delivered a bleak maiden budget, raising the deficit estimate for the 2018/19 fiscal year to 4% of GDP, while halving the growth forecast for this year to 0.7%. “The budget deficit erased the confidence of the market and the rand sold off quite sharply. The rand remains on the defensive,” said ETM economist Halen Bothma.
