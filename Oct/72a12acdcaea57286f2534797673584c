In a series of tweets on Sunday morning, Gigaba says he and his wife are saddened that the video containing material of a sexual nature, meant only for them, was stolen when his phone was hacked in 2016 or 2017. JOHANNESBURG - Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has revealed that a sex tape is circulating in political circles and has been used in blackmail attempts against him. In a series of tweets on Sunday morning, Gigaba says he and his wife are saddened that the video containing material of a sexual nature, meant only for them, was stolen when his phone was hacked in 2016 or 2017. Gigaba says this video has been at the centre of a number of blackmail and extortion attempts, dating back to the period immediately following his appointment as Finance Minister in March 2017. Gigaba has publicly apologised to the rest of his family, especially his children, his in-laws and the South Africans for what he calls pain and embarrassment. The minister's spokesperson Vuyo Mkhize says the video has been used for extortion and blackmail by unknown people. “His wife does not feature in the video. His wife was the intended recipient for the video. The information that he received is that the video is currently circulating in political circles, but he’s not in a position to say that they’re responsible for it.”      (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
