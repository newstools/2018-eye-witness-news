This after two reports into alleged corruption and maladministration at the city compiled by law firm Bowmans were discussed by councillors. CAPE TOWN – Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille will be the subject of a criminal investigation. The City of Cape Town’s council adopted the recommendation of two reports into alleged corruption and maladministration at the city compiled by law firm Bowmans in a closed meeting late on Thursday afternoon. One of two reports has found De Lille prevented former city manager Achmat Ebrahim from reporting alleged corruption within the transport authority to the council. The council has agreed to institute disciplinary steps against De Lille and other councillors and officials implicated in the reports which will include criminal investigations. Cape metro regional chairperson Grant Twigg explains how the process will unfold. “There are two processes that now need to be followed. One is in respect of officials and now goes to the city manager, and for the councillors involved that goes to the speaker for investigation.” The DA’s provincial leadership say they had to probe the allegations even though it has caused friction within the party. De Lille has consistently rejected the allegations against her and has long said she would welcome a probe into her conduct. The DA’s Western Cape leadership announced earlier on Thursday evening that the reports have also been referred to the council speaker and city manager for action. Earlier on Thursday, five DA councillors resigned and staged a dramatic walkout from what was expected to be De Lille’s last council meeting. They've accused the party of racism and unfair treatment.  (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
