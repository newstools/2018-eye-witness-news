JOHANNESBURG - Some parts of Eldorado Park Ext 7 in the south of Johannesburg have lost power due to a transformer substation which caught fire on Friday night. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The spokesperson of City Power, Isaac Mangena, says the attempted theft of the infrastructure in the area or homeless squatters, who usually start a fire near the station for warmth, could have started the blaze. Mangena says technicians are working to restore power. “City Power officials are currently on the scene and investigating the cause of the fire. We’re expecting the power to be restored by late evening, but due to the rain it might take a while.”    (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
