The #MeToo hashtag and campaign continue to gain support one year after they gained momentum. JOHANNESBURG – It has been a year since the #MeToo movement started on social media platform Twitter. The hashtag gained momentum following tweets by US actress Alyssa Milano as a means of addressing the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment in America.  Women across the world have since used social media to share horrific stories of how they too have been victims of abuse at the hands of men.     The abuse ranges from sexual, emotional, mental, financial and more. In South Africa, author and journalist Melinda Ferguson shared her story about how her abuse started when she was four-years-old until she was a teenager. Then former ANC MP and singer Jennifer Ferguson accused Safa president Danny Jordaan of raping her 20 years ago. In the US, so many women have come out accusing men in the entertainment industry of gross abuse. Take a look at some of the key moments of the movement: Timeline of main developments in the #MeToo anti-sexual harassment movement.  The men accused of sexual assault include: Harvey Weinstein, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Rusell Simmonds, Ryan Seacrest, James Franco, Aziz Ansari, Steven Seagal… There are so many men on the list that one can’t help but think of the hashtag #MenAreTrash This year the movement kicked off in China, with professors being accused of sexual harassment.
