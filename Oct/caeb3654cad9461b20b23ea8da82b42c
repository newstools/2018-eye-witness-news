Madikizela says this is due to a lack of access roads between shacks. “First and foremost, something that’s very urgent now, is to talk about how we’re going to resettle people in a way that will avoid the situation we’ve seen, which resulted into this massive fire. So, we must try and avoid that going forward.” This is the fourth fire to destroy parts of a Cape Town community over the past few days. #CapricornFire Residents young and old clearing debris.
