The teams made their picks from the six international marquee players and then filled the remaining 14 places in each squad from the foreign/Kolpak and SA players. CAPE TOWN - South Africaâ€™s inaugural Mzansi Super League (MSL) T20 competition is fast becoming a reality as the main player draft was held at Montecasino in Johannesburg today, with 71 foreign players going into the draft. Each team had already been allocated a big-name marquee Protea player as they announced their respective coaches as well. The teams made their picks from the six international marquee players and then filled the remaining 14 places in each squad from the foreign/Kolpak and South African players who had applied to enter the draft. In the mini-round to select the international marquee players, the Durban Heat had first shot and went for leg spinning wizard Rashid Khan of Afghanistan, the number one ranked bowler in the current ICC T20 rankings. They were followed by the Jozi Stars who went for the legendary Chris Gayle of the Windies. Paarl Rocks followed with another Windies player, Dwayne Bravo. Cape Town Blitz then took Dawid Malan of England followed by Tshwane Spartans with England white ball captain Eoin Morgan and Nelson Mandela Bay Giants with England opening batsman Jason Roy. In the first official round of the draft, the Giants led off with Chris Morris, followed by the Spartans with Lungi Ngidi, the Blitz with Andile Phehlukwayo, the Rocks with Tabraiz Shamsi, the Stars with Kolpak star Dane Vilas and the Heat with David Miller. Lutho Sipamla became the first rookie to be chosen in round eight by the Spartans and they followed with another rookie in Tony de Zorzi in Round Nine. Other rookies signed were Sinethemba Qeshile for the Stars, Dyllan Matthews for the Giants, Okuhle Cele for the Heat, Eathan Bosch for the Rocks, and Kyle Verreynne for the Blitz.
