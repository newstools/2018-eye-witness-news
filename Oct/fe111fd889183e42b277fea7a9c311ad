The party says the commission will meet next week to consider the report and the cases of leaders and members implicated and/or accused of wrong-doing in the report. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it has written to the chairperson of its Integrity Commission to refer its members implicated in the VBS Mutual Bank saga to the commission. In a statement released on Saturday morning, the party says the commission will meet next week to consider the report and the cases of leaders and members implicated and/or accused of wrong-doing in the report. The Reserve Bank released Advocate Terry Motau's report on Wednesday which implicated 53 people and companies in fraud and corruption worth nearly R2 billion. Spokesperson Pule Mabe says this is in line with renewing the party. “The Officials of the ANC will also meet with the Officials of Limpopo, to discuss the response of the province to the serious allegations raised in the report. These actions are in line with the restoration and enhancement of the values and integrity of the ANC. It also reflects the determination of ANC Officials, as discussed at their recent lekgotla, to lead the process of renewal and unity of the ANC." That report implicates the deputy chairperson of the ANC in Limpopo Florence Radzilani, who allegedly invested R300 million from the Vhembe District Municipality in the embattled bank and in turn received bribes. Provincial treasurer Danny Msiza has also been implicated as a Kingpin who played a role by ensuring municipalities make illegal deposits with the bank. On Thursday, ANC’s head of elections Fikile Mbalula said the party will act decisively to deal with its leaders implicated in the report. “The ANC is determined to act decisively. The ANC didn’t send anybody to be corrupt.” Aside from senior ANC officials, the brother of the Economic Freedom Fighters' Floyd Shivambu and former KPMG bosses have also been named as among the 50 recipients of the almost R2 billion syphoned out of the bank. Advocate Terry Motau's report, titled The Great Bank Heist, recommends that the implicated parties be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority to be criminally charged and that the Asset Forfeiture Unit initiate processes to recover the stolen funds.
