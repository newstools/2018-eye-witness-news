JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has suspended its head of Assurance and Forensics pending an investigation into internal audit reports. The power utility announced on Thursday that Molefi Nkhabu has been placed on precautionary suspension in order to investigate transactions that he signed-off which exonerated certain former Eskom executives who've since been implicated in maladministration. Eskom does not, however, name the former executives but several have left the company in the past year, including former CFO Anoj Singh. The utility says due to Nkhabu's seniority and the seriousness of the allegations against him, management decided it would be best to suspend him until the investigation is finalised. Eskom’s Khulu Phasiwe said: “Management felt it was necessary to ask him to step aside so that they can run the necessary investigations. He will be given the chance to come and explain himself when that information has been put together.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
