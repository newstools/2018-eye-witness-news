The 30-year-old had had apparently left South Africa to holiday on the island. JOHANNESBURG - A delegation from the International Relations Department will visit a South African woman in Mauritius on Friday, who is accused of drug trafficking. The woman was arrested in her hotel room last month after she was found with pellets of heroin in her luggage. According to Mauritian media, on arrival, the woman was heard communicating telephonically with a local syndicate, with the calls picked up by an anti-drug squad. Dirco's Ndivhuwo Mabaya says that today's consular visit is for officials to talk to local authorities about the case against the woman. "The mission is engaging with her and we have also been in contact with her relatives." However, he says that there is not much the department can do as the woman will have to be prosecuted under Mauritian law. Mabaya says that it is standard protocol for International Relations to visit all South Africans in distress in other countries. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
