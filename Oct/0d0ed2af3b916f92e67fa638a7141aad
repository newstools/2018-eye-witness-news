At least 34 pupils from Nomsa Mapongwana Primary School in Khayelitsha have been affected by the blaze in Town Two. CAPE TOWN - There is a concern for pupils affected by a devastating shack fire in Khayelitsha  over the weekend. At least 34 learners from the Nomsa Mapongwana Primary School have been affected by the blaze in Town Two on Saturday. One person died and more than 2,300 others were displaced. School principal Vuyani Somaxhaka said: “Their books have been burnt down and their clothes as well, so some of them could not come to school.” At the same time, Khayelitsha residents who lost their homes in the devastating fire are working hard to ensure they have rooves up by Monday night. Nombusiso Ngcingwana one of the 1,355 residents who lost nearly everything she owned in the blaze along with her neighbours, has jumped right into rebuilding what they lost more than 48 hours ago. About 140 structures made of zinc sheets and wooden poles have already been built on the section of land razed by the fire. The City of Cape Town is distributing starter kits for residents to rebuild three-by-three-metre structures, which is made up of zinc sheets, wooden poles, three packets of nails, a door and a window. The city’s Mandy Thomas says the municipality’s resources are being thinly spread in light of the Philippi fire and a smaller one in Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay at the start of the weekend. About 1,400 residents were also displaced in a separate fire incident in Kosovo, in Philippi. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
