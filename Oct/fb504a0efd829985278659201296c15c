It's understood that one worker died at Dishaba Mine in Limpopo and the other at Kopanang Mine on the West Rand. JOHANNESBURG – The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) says it is shocked by the death of two miners in separate incidents, bringing the total number of mining-related deaths this year to 81. It's understood that one worker died at Dishaba Mine in Limpopo and the other at Kopanang Mine on the West Rand. Both accidents took place on Thursday. Amcu's Joseph Mathunjwa says: “These accidents are repeatable accidents, it’s not something that’s new. It has happened before and it proves clearly to us as a union, that there’s not much emphasis or investment in prevention of occurrence of such accidents.” The deaths occurred while the mining industry gathered at the 2018 Mine Health Summit in Benoni.
