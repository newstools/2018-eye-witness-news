Sunday marked what would have been Sisulu’s 100th birthday. JOHANNESBURG - Parliament has commended Albertina Sisulu’s contribution to the fight against the oppressive apartheid regime and advocating for women's rights. Sunday marked what would have been Sisulu’s 100th birthday. The day was observed with a church service and wreath-laying ceremony attended by Sisulu’s family and senior African National Congress (ANC)  politicians.   Sisulu advocated for women’s rights in the 1950s and nominated Nelson Mandela as president in 1994. She died in 2011. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says she played an important role in the lives of many. “She became one of the distinguished torchbearers during apartheid. She was a voice against injustice and a rock upon which her family and many struggle activists leaned on.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
