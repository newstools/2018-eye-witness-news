This is in light of the Grabouw Civic Association's John Michaels who claims a sick elderly woman was refused medical assistance last week and died in front of the hospital CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Health MEC, Nomafrench Mbombo, is investigating allegations of poor service at Helderberg hospital, in Somerset West. The Grabouw Civic Association's John Michaels claims a sick elderly woman was refused medical assistance last week. He claimed the woman died in front of the hospital, even after he asked staff for help. Michaels has created a Facebook group where at least a dozen people have complained about bad service at the facility. “I cannot believe that you can treat a person like that and the whole time I tried to alert the hospital staff about this lady and all of them ignored me, and the very next day I alerted the MEC about this.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
