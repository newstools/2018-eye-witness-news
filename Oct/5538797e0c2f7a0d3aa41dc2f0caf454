He says these injuries can be severe and can lead to death if untreated. “The signs and symptoms of these heat injuries are cramps, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, fainting and seizure. Stay well hydrated by drinking a lot of water, keep a close eye on babies, the elderly and children. Ensure that they stay well hydrated at all time,” said Meiring. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
