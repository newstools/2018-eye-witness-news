Two high-profile cases involving Russian agents attempted to infiltrate sites in Switzerland. ZURICH - Russia spying in Switzerland is significant and increasing, the Swiss intelligence agency said on Friday after two high-profile cases involving alleged Russian agents attempting to infiltrate sites in Switzerland. “I cannot give a lot of details about the Russian activities in Switzerland but it is clear we have more activities than before,” Jean-Philippe Gaudin, director of the NDB intelligence service, told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference. “I cannot say how many spies, but it is significant. Of course, I have a lot of information but I will share that with my colleagues elsewhere and not with the media.”
