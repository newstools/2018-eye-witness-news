Officers opened fire on the pair after they resisted arrest early on Tuesday morning in Clermont. JOHANNESBURG – Police have shot dead two men who allegedly killed two security guards. Officers opened fire on Lindokuhle Cebekhulu (24) and Mbuyiselo Mthonti (26) after they resisted arrest early on Tuesday morning in Clermont, Pinetown. The pair had attacked security guards, identified as Eric Ngobese and Boykie Moyo, from 24/7 Security Services who were shot in their patrol vehicle in Soweto near Maponya Mall last week. A video of the guards' shooting went viral on social media, while images of the deceased suspects have also made the rounds. Police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo says, “Our Organised Unit from Gauteng were acting on information when they went to an informal settlement in Clermont, just outside Pinetown. When confronting the suspects, the suspects resisted, which resulted in both of them being shot and killed.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
