JOHANNESBURG - Harmony Gold signed a three-year wage agreement with South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and two other unions on Wednesday, according to the Twitter account of NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu. No other details were immediately available but NUM last month inked a three-year wage deal with AngloGold Ashanti that saw a 12% pay hike for entry-level underground workers in the first year, more than double the inflation rate. Category four to eight employees will receive increases of R700 a month for the first year, R750 for the second and R825 for the final year of the agreement, while officials, miners and artisans will receive 6.3% more each year. Unions will continue negotiations with Village Main Reef Limited on Thursday. The NUM's Kolekile Sipunzi says the unions were hoping for a higher offer from Harmony Gold. “It is an agreement we believe will sustain the company going forward, because it’s no use for us to demand increases that will, at the end of the day, force the company to issue us with what they cannot afford to pay. We believe this will sustain the company for some time.”
