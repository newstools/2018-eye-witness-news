Mohammed Tamimi was left with a large defect after the bullet entered his face below his nose, broke his jaw and entered his skull. JOHANNESBURG – A South African doctor who was part of the medical team that performed surgery on a Palestinian teen activist says he expects him to make a full recovery. Mohammed Tamimi underwent surgery at the Sandton Mediclinic on Monday after Israeli soldiers shot him in the face during a protest against America’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December. Tamimi was left with a large defect after the bullet entered his face below his nose, broke his jaw and entered his skull. Dr Jameel Desai says the teenager is responding well to treatment. “We’re expecting that he’ll actually make a full recovery, we’re encouraged by what we’ve seen already. These Palestinian children are resilient, they’re positive and strong.” Meanwhile, the Royal House of Mandela has commended the entire medical team.
