Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions Silas Ramaite told Parliament that budget constraints are severely hampering the NPA’s ability to do its job. JOHANNESBURG - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) says it's shocked by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)’s financial and staff crisis. The NPA needs R761 million to fill over 1,000 vacancies including 244 posts which are deemed critical. Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions Silas Ramaite told Parliament that budget constraints are severely hampering the NPA’s ability to do its job. Outa spokesperson Stephanie Fick says the crisis increases the risk of perpetrators escaping justice. “We need the NPA to quickly set up, do what needs to be done, and start prosecuting and holding people accountable, and restore confidence in one of the most important institutions in South Africa.” The Department of Justice and Correctional Services says it's been talking to the NPA about solutions to its staff and budget shortages. Spokesperson Mukoni Ratshitanga says the whole justice cluster has been hit hard by government austerity measures and there’s no budget to hire more people. “To look at rationalising the work of the justice services as a whole in order to look at possibilities of shared services, to generate efficiency, and savings.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
