CAPE TOWN - The George fire has reached Fernridge where at least one shack is on fire. Evacuations have been called for the informal settlements in Blanco, Golden Valley, Step Aside, Barrie Road in Glenbarrie, as well as in Heatherlands and Glenbarrie full residential area. Western Cape provincial communication officer Lauren Howard explains: “Residents living on the borders of the town and forest are requested to voluntarily evacuate their homes due to danger of smoke inhalation. The fire remains active on the slope.” Donations towards the firefighting efforts are to be delivered to the George Fire Brigade at Mitchell Street. Fernridge resident Tania Tait was forced to pack up her family, pets and personal belongings. She says they've moved to a house in Sedgefield. “I was getting ready for work, but my family said we need to evacuate. We started packing. I told my girls to pack for a week. We cleared the fridge and also got our animals.” About 180 people are being housed at the George Town Hall. Close to 16,600 hectares of land have already burned.
