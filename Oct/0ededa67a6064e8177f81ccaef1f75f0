Schumer told the crowd: "That's what we're going to do: We're going to keep showing up and no matter how this goes, they cannot keep us down. "We will win. A vote for Kavanaugh is a vote saying 'Women don't matter.' Let's stay together. Let's fight. Let's keep showing up." The I Feel Pretty co-stars were among the 302 people police said they had arrested at the demonstration. They did not release names of those who were detained "due to the large number being processed."
