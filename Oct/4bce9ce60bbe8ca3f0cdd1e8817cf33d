Reports have linked Brian Shivambu, who reportedly pocketed more than R16 million, to EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu. PRETORIA - It’s being reported that a person named Brian Shivambu mentioned in the VBS Mutual Bank report as having scored more than R16 million is the younger brother of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu. News24 and the Daily Maverick have linked the Shivambu mentioned in the report to the political leader. In his report, Advocate Terry Motau established that more than 50 people and companies syphoned off nearly R2 billion from the bank over 36 months. In March when the Reserve Bank placed VBS Bank under curatorship, the EFF called on its members to defend the financial institution. The red berets said they could not allow a black bank to be attacked. Now, its emerged Floyd's brother reportedly pocketed more than R16 million in unlawful payments. Motau’s report does not reveal when or why Brian was paid the sum of money. The EFF has not responded to this development.
