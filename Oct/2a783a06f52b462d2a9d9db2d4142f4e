Msiza is among the 53 individuals and companies accused of stealing over R2 billion from the bank. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Limpopo Treasurer Danny Msiza has given Advocate Terry Motau until the end of business on Monday to retract parts of his VBS bank heist report and apologise for accusing him of being at the centre of the looting. Msiza is among the 53 individuals and companies accused of stealing over R2 billion from the bank. At the same time, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy leader Floyd Shivambu’s brother, Brian, has instructed his lawyer to file papers in the High Court this week to also take the report on legal review. Danny Msiza says that the report has "hurt his reputation, dignity, career and family." Msiza claims that he was never given an opportunity to give his side of the story and that his rights have been infringed. Meanwhile, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu's brother, Brian, has also been implicated in the scandal allegedly receiving R16 million. Both Shivambu brothers have denied receiving any money from the VBS bank heist. The EFF is expected to hold a media briefing on Tuesday to discuss the VBS saga. The ANC has referred all party members implicated in the scandal to their internal integrity committee.
