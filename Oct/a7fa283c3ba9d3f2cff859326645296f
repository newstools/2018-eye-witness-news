Speaking on behalf of Molewa's children, Sethema says his mother will be sorely missed. He says her death has not yet sunk in. “I’ve been asking myself will I ever adjust to the fact that she is really gone, death has really hit home. Mama held our family together [and] raised us under difficult circumstances. The minister's grandson Ogone Kitchin says he believes he will see his grandmother someday. “I don’t mean to go against anybody’s religious beliefs or practices, but I hope you find comfort in the fact that we will see her again someday [and] that her tragic passing is not the end of the road.” Earlier, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who delivered the eulogy, commended Molewa's achievements and suggested that she should receive a Nobel Peace Prize for her outstanding contribution.
