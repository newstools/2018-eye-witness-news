The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration joined the dispute, but Sasol refused to make any concessions. Solidarity's Johan Kruger said: “It’s not only about Sasol, but it’s also a bigger issue. It’s about dividing the working class in races. We have been there, we can go forward, we must go forward, we cannot exclude white workers from a benefit scheme on account of their skin colour.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
