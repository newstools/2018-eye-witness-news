It's reported a major VBS shareholder informed the then deputy president early last year about the bank heist and apparently promised to do something about it then. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa allegedly knew about the widespread looting at VBS Mutual Bank last year but did not take action to stop it. The City Press is reporting that a major VBS shareholder informed the then deputy president early last year about the bank heist and apparently promised to do something about it then. On Wednesday, the South African Reserve Bank released a damning report in which 53 individuals and companies are implicated in the looting almost R2 billion of the indebted bank. The City Press is reporting that in June 2016, more than six months before a major VBS shareholder met with then Deputy President Ramaphosa, the shareholder reported what he knew to the Reserve Bank as well as what was known as the Financial Services Board. On Saturday night, Ramaphosa called for strong action to be taken against those implicated in the VBS report. “The VBS saga is the most concerning one just as much as the Steinhoff saga. It hurts our people to see these please who are involved in all these corrupt activities going on with their lives as though nothing has happened.” He was addressing business leaders in KwaZulu-Natal during a gala dinner. Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko has not been available for comment on Sunday morning, however, she told the newspaper that there was no record of such a meeting between Ramaphosa and a VBS shareholder. At the same time, Ramaphosa is expected to hand over more than 4,000 hectares of land to the community of KwaMkhwanazi in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal, on Sunday to mark the successful transfer of land and ownership to the community. Meanwhile, the ANC along with its Integrity Commission will meet this week to consider ways to deal with its members who are implicated in the VBS bank ‘heist’ report. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says the action will help restore the integrity of the party. “These actions are in line with the restoration and enhancement of the values and integrity of the ANC.It also reflects the determination of ANC Officials, as discussed at their recent lekgotla, to lead the process of renewal and unity of the ANC.” ANC OFFICIALS IMPLICATED That report implicates the deputy chairperson of the ANC in Limpopo Florence Radzilani, who allegedly invested R300 million from the Vhembe District Municipality in the embattled bank and in turn received bribes. Provincial treasurer Danny Msiza has also been implicated as a Kingpin who played a role by ensuring municipalities make illegal deposits with the bank. On Thursday, ANC’s head of elections Fikile Mbalula said the party will act decisively to deal with its leaders implicated in the report. “The ANC is determined to act decisively. The ANC didn’t send anybody to be corrupt.” Aside from senior ANC officials, the brother of the Economic Freedom Fighters' Floyd Shivambu and former KPMG bosses have also been named as among the 50 recipients of the almost R2 billion syphoned out of the bank. Advocate Terry Motau's report, titled 'The Great Bank Heist', recommends that the implicated parties be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority to be criminally charged and that the Asset Forfeiture Unit initiate processes to recover the stolen funds.
