City Manager Moeketsi Mosola wants the court to interdict the distribution of a preliminary report into allegations of tender irregularities against him. JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga and embattled City Manager Moeketsi Mosola will take their fight to the Labour Court on Thursday morning. Mosola wants the court to interdict the distribution of a preliminary report into allegations of tender irregularities against him. The investigation into Mosola centres around the allocation of a multi-billion-rand tender to engineering company GladAfrica Group. Msimanga tried to suspend Mosola over the allegations, failed and is opposing the application. He says the city manager's court bid is confusing. “He was saying everything should be made public and this was an attempt because if you’re taking a report to council, then there should be that transparency that talks to the report itself, but also talks to a process going forward. There is a preliminary report that talks to a process that is also going to unfold.” GladAfrica received the three-year contract last November to assist with the roll-out of infrastructure projects. It later emerged that the tender was awarded without following proper procedures and council sanctioned a preliminary investigation into the matter. Msimanga's spokesperson Sam Mgobozi said: “I can today confirm that the African National Congress has indeed tabled an urgent motion to suspend the city manager of the capital city. This motion was tabled at the Speaker’s office and it’s up to the speaker to come to a determination of whether or not she will allow for council to entertain the motion.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
