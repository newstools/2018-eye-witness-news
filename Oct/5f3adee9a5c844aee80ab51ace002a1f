Ramaphosa said there is already an awareness of the problems facing the economy and the stumbling blocks to economic growth. He says people must not complain. “We agreed before we came here that we would not use this summit as a platform for lamentation. We will use this summit to seek and find solutions.” He said this summit must respond to the problems. “We should aim to reduce unemployment to at least 6% by 2030. We do need to acknowledge that we will not be able to reach that target unless we do something extraordinary.” He said the summit will emerge with a framework agreement which is ambitious but achievable.
