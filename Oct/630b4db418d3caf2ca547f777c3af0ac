The unit comprises more than 80 members with more being trained. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker says the officers will be deployed to various train lines from next week. “We have 84 members who are already trained. Training for the remainder of the 100 will be finalised in the next two weeks and then we will strengthen it with a further 50 which will be trained as part of our internal team. This will be a force multiplier in the system.” Meanwhile, Blade Nzimande says Cape Town's train service is in a crisis. He says the unit is crucial in order to help trains get back on track, and to provide commuters with a decent service. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
