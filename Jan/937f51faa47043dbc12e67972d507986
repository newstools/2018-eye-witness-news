                                         CAPE TOWN - Patricia de Lille says she’s confident the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) top brass will fairly consider her submissions on why she should remain Cape Town’s mayor. She says she’s not letting the political cloud hanging over her head distract her from dealing with the city’s pressing water woes. The DA federal executive is meeting on Sunday to decide whether it still has confidence in De Lille to lead the metro. The party's Cape Town regional executive says they don’t think she should continue in the job.
