                                         ACCRA - Two football players who helped secure their respective countries a spot at the World Cup are vying for the position of African Footballer of the Year. Liverpool's Senegalese Sadio Mane and Egyptian Mohamed Salah are up against former 2015 recipient Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund and Gabon. The winner will be announced at the annual Confederation of African Football awards being hosted in Ghana on Thursday evening. It’s a tough decision for selectors, but only one man can take the coveted prize. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (28) was the top scorer in the Bundisliga with Borussia Dortmund, but has been criticized for not doing enough to help his native Gabon in its World Cup qualifying campaign. Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, both 25-years-old, helped Senegal and Egypt qualify for the World Cup and have emerged as leading players in the English Premier League. All will be revealed at tonight’s ceremony, taking place at the Accra International Convention Centre.
