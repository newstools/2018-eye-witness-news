Donald Trump has written to the 30th AU summit, assuring leaders of his warmest regards. PRETORIA - In Monday’s final declaration from the African Union summit in Addis Ababa, leaders are expected to take United States President Donald Trump  to task for his foul-mouthed dismissal of the continent’s countries. This after the African Union’s new chairman, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, gave him a free ride on the issue at their meeting in Davos last week. Trump has written to the 30th AU summit, assuring leaders of his warmest regards. He has also said he’s sending his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on an extensive tour of the continent later this year. Will this be enough to mollify members of the 55-nation grouping? Some, like South Africa, have taken tough diplomatic action to express their displeasure at Trump’s scatological reference to their countries.
