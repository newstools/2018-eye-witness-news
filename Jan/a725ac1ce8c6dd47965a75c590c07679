                                         CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly is drawing up new rules to govern President Jacob Zuma's removal by impeachment. Section 89 of the Constitution allows for the removal of a sitting president on grounds of a serious violation of the Constitution or the law, serious misconduct or inability to perform the functions of office. The Constitutional Court last month ordered the National Assembly to put in place rules to give effect to this provision, with a timeline. The National Assembly has 120 days from the date of the Constitutional Court’s 29 December ruling to put impeachment rules in place and 180 days from that date to launch proceedings for Zuma’s removal.
