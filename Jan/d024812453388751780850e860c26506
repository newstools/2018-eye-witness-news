                                         JOHANNESBURG - Fast bowlers Duanne Olivier and Lungi Ngidi have been added to the Proteas Test squad, as cover for the injured Dale Steyn ahead of the second Test match against India at SuperSport Park in Centurion starting on 13 January.  Steyn injured his left heel while bowling in India’s first innings on Day 2 of the first Test match at Newlands in Cape Town. Scans confirmed that Steyn would miss the rest of the three-match series, and would be reassessed again in 4-6 weeks’ time to determine the extent of the injury.  South Africa won the pulsating first Test by 72 runs, after bowling India out for 135 on Day 4. Vernon Philander was named man of the match for taking career best figures of 6/42 in a spell that ripped India’s batting order apart.  Olivier has 17 Test match wickets in five matches, while this is Ngidi’s first involvement in the Test squad after having represented South Africa in T20 Internationals before getting injured.  Commenting on the additions, Proteas coach Ottis Gibson said: “We have to replace Dale who has picked up an unfortunate injury. I felt really sorry for him because he has done a lot of good stuff and put in the hard work to get back to where he was.  “We have called up Duanne Olivier who has been with us before and we will also add Lungi Ngidi to the squad. I have heard a lot of good things about Ngidi so I’m looking forward to see what he brings. We are expecting similar bowling-friendly conditions in Pretoria so this pair will bolster up our options heading into the match.”  The squad will travel to Centurion on Wednesday and details of the training and media schedule will be advised soon.
