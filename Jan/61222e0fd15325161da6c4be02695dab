                                         JOHANNESBURG- The Proteas fast bowlers ripped through the Indian batting line-up, to leave the visitors reeling at tea on 82/7 still 126 runs short of victory in the first test at Newlands in Cape Town.  In a frenetic day of cricket, in which 12 wickets had fallen by tea, the Indians thought they had gained the upper hand when they bowled South Africa out for 130 just before the lunch break, leaving themselves with a target of 208 runs for victory. Opener Murali Vijay survived two LBW decisions on the DRS system, but his fellow opener Shikar Dhawan wasn’t as fortunate as he failed to control a well-directed short ball from Morne Morkel to be easily caught in the gully. Vijay didn’t make use of his lifelines as he soon edged a Vernon Philander delivery to slip. Captain Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma steadied the ship with a decent partnership before Philander returned to trap Kohli in front of his wicket. Sharma was also given a reprieve when Keshav Maharaj failed to hang on to a top edge off the bowling of Kagiso Rabada, but it was Philander again who struck by removing Sharma as he chopped a ball back onto his stumps.  Wriddiman Saha was the last wicket to fall before the tea break and the Proteas will be looking to take the last three remaining wickets to wrap up the first test.
