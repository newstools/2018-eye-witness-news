PRETORIA - Israeli pilots have refused to fly asylum seekers deported by the Tel Aviv government to African countries. Their action follows those of German pilots in 2017 who refused to take deportees to Afghanistan and countries they consider unsafe. The El Al pilots made their feelings known on their Facebook site. Their action is largely symbolic. The Israeli government doesn’t use the national carrier to move deportees, in terms of legislation passed to expel thousands of them, they take them to Rwanda and Uganda, which have been paid to accept them. They’re flown on other carriers via Jordan or Ethiopia. The Israeli NGO Zizim Community Action is pressing pilots to follow the example of German flyers who refused 222 flights in 2017 carrying deportees out of Europe.
