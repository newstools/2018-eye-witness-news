The Presidency has refuted the reports that President Jacob Zuma used the meeting to demand that Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma be appointed as deputy president of the country. JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency says it has noted several distortions in reports regarding the meeting held by President Jacob Zuma and deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this month in Durban. It says the meeting was about the two leaders updating each other on matters in both government and the governing party, following the assumption of Ramaphosaâ€™s African National Congress (ANC) presidency. The Presidency has refuted the reports that Zuma used the meeting to demand that Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma be appointed as deputy president of the country. It says the leaders have both indicated that their meetings are now critical to ensure interaction between the governing party and government since President Zuma is no longer a member of the ANC's top six. Last week, the City Press reported that Ramaphosa's backers were planning for him to take over from Zuma much earlier, in order for the ANC president to deliver the State of the Nation Address next month. Zuma's supporters are reportedly negotiating the conditions for him to step down, which include that some of the ministers he appointed be retained.
