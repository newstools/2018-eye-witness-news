                                         ACCRA - Banyana Banyana has won the African national women’s Team of the Year award.  The award was handed down at the CAF awards ceremony in Ghana on Thursday night, where Egyptian Mohamed Salah was awarded the coveted African Footballer of the year prize. South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan was there to support them. Moments before the ceremony Jordaan told Eyewitness News that he was holding thumbs that both Banyana Banyana and player Thembi Kgatlana, nominated for women’s player of the year, would take top honours. But Nigerian Asisat Oshoala was instead crowned player of the year. Meanwhile, Jordaan says that they’ve already set the ball rolling to try secure Bafana Bafana a spot in the 2022 World Cup. "We're starting a new four year period... we’ve done well in under-20, the under-17 team was in the World Cup... we’ve qualified for the Olympics. So we think we have a broad base of players ready to be integrated in new Bafana Bafana team." He says that all five African teams who’ve qualified for the World Cup this year have all renewed their teams, which is a strategy South Africa will follow too.
