The rail operator has experienced a spate of incidents over the past week. Officials suspended services on the central line after a security guard was killed at Chris Hani station last week. This year is looking much like 2017 did when it comes to Metrorail services, with the stop-start operations on the central line are only adding to commuters' woes. If it's not constant delays, security concerns are front of mind for train users. A man jumped to his death while fleeing a group of armed men on a train between Fish Hoek and Cape Town on Saturday. Last week, a security guard was robbed and shot dead at Chris Hani station, while two children had to be hospitalised after a group of people getting off a train at St James station sprayed a mixture of pool chemicals and a domestic detergent in a carriage. No arrests have been made in any of these cases.
