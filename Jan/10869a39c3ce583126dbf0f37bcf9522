The tribunal says both parties have agreed that there will be no retrenchments for a period of two years from the implementation date. JOHANNESBURG - The Competition Tribunal has conditionally approved the merger of Unitrans Automotive, owned by Steinhoff International Holdings Limited, with Action Ford car dealership. The tribunal says both parties have agreed that there will be no retrenchments for a period of two years from the implementation date. The Competition Tribunal says its notes that Unitrans Automotive controls several entities and is active in the sale of new and pre-owned cars, while Ford controls no other firm and operates five dealerships in various provinces. Meanwhile, a group of Steinhoff creditors have appointed financial adviser PJT Partners and law firm Latham Watkins to represent them in any potential debt restructuring, PJT said. Steinhoff, owner of more than 40 retail brands including Poundland in Britain, is fighting for survival after admitting “accounting irregularities” last month that triggered an 85% share slide. Steinhoff has been trying to find short-term funds to avoid parts of its business pulling down the whole group.__Additional reporting by Reuters. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
