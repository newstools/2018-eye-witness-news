JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks have arrested a senior administrative officer working in the provincial Roads and Transport Department for allegedly tampering with drivers licences. Officials received a tip-off about irregular transactions between July and December last year. The accused allegedly issued irregular drivers licences. Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi says the officer has been suspended while he answers to five internal misconduct charges. “There are indications that he didn’t do this alone. We believe there might be several other employees or municipalities involved with this. We will have to see whether the network extends to other provinces as well.”   (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
