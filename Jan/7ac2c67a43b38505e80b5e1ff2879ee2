The H&M advert featuring Liam Mango sparked global outrage after he modelled a hoodie which read “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle”. CAPE TOWN – Terry Mango, the mother of five-year-old Liam Mango who modelled a hoodie for H&M, says people need to respect different views on racism. The H&M advert featuring Liam sparked global outrage after he modelled a hoodie which read “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle”. His mother has since come under fire for defending the advert.  In an interview with British daytime show This Morning, Mango says the public outcry is not an overreaction. “'It is not an overreaction when it comes to racism. Everybody should act differently based on their own opinions on what racism is.” The mother says knows what racism is and has been called a ‘monkey’ in the past. “I know what racism is, I have had racist remarks directed to me. I’ve been called a monkey before on a cruise ship and my reaction was the same as the world’s right now.” However, she explains that she did not view the advert as racist. “To put the T-shirt and the word ‘monkey’ with racism maybe that is not my way of looking at it. I’m just looking at Liam, a young black boy modelling a T-shirt that has the word monkey on it. And I think everybody should respect opinions on racism.”  She has also shared concerns for her son’s well-being and career, reminding people that he has done nothing wrong. Last week, H&M apologised for the advert and removed it. However, the Economic Freedom Fighters staged protests and vandalises stores in the Western Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng. Musicians The Weeknd and G-Eazy also cut ties with clothing retailer.
