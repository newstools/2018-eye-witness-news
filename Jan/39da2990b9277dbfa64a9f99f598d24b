                                         ACCRA - South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan says there’s ongoing dialogue with interim Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis about the timing of a permanent appointment. Ellis has been interim coach since August 2016 and under her leadership the team was awarded the African National Women’s Team of the Year Award last week.  Jordaan says they have invested a lot in Ellis, but are still unsure about timing. “If coaches are not successful, particularly at the senior level, the media, who’s now the architects and cheerleaders for Desiree to be appointed, if she must not qualify for Afcon or the World Cup, they will all be after her.” Banyana Banyana were up against the under-20 teams from Nigeria and Ghana for the coveted African National Women’s Team of the Year award, which they won following their Cosafa Women’s Championship victory. At the same time, Jordaan has brushed aside criticism that Ellis has not been confirmed Banyana Banyana coach.  The Safa boss says that in women’s football, in particular, none of the coaches have worked elsewhere. “They come off the field, they do the coaching course and then they become senior or national team coaches. Now that is extraordinary. It doesn’t happen.” He says they have invested a lot in their coaches and they’re in discussion with Ellis about the timing of a permanent appointment.
