PRETORIA - Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates say President Donald Trump’s “America first” message could do long-term damage to the United States’s influence in Africa. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gates says by turning his back on Africa, Trump is handing it to the competition. The second richest man in the world has spent $12 billion fighting malaria and tuberculosis in Africa. Gates says too much “America first” risks losing African stability and goodwill. While Trump looks away from Africa, countries like China are expanding their influence across the continent. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway says Trump, who’s due in Davos on Thursday, will be stressing his American policy.
