                                         JOHANNESBURG- The Proteas have suffered a blow to their fast bowling stocks as Cricket South Africa have confirmed that Dale Steyn has been ruled out of the entire series with an ankle injury.  Steyn suffered the injury on Day Two of the first Test at Newlands in Cape Town and has not taken any further part in the match. Steyn has seen a foot and ankle specialist, who confirmed that the fast bowler will be out of action for up to six weeks. CSA also says that they will confirm a replacement for Steyn at the end of the Test match. The "Phalaborwa Express" was making his return to Test match cricket after 14 months out with a serious shoulder injury which he sustained on the tour of Australia in 2016. Steyn has since moved just two wickets short of Shaun Pollock’s South African record of 421 wickets. Steyn took two wickets in the Indian’s first innings of 209 all out, before he pulled up with the ankle injury.  Steyn will undergo further assessments in 4-6 weeks’ time.  It is still unclear whether he will bat during South Africa’s second innings.
