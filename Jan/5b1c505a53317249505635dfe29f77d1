The DA’s legal commission is expected to conclude the disciplinary process against Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille within the next 60 days. JOHANNESBURG – Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille is set to face a Democratic Alliance (DA) disciplinary process for bringing the party into disrepute. The DA’s legal commission is expected to conclude the process within the next 60 days. In the meantime, she’s been asked to relinquish her leadership of the city’s water crisis to deputy mayor Ian Neilson and mayoral committee member, Xanthea Limberg. De Lille made a brief appearance before the DA’s federal executive on Sunday morning, while it deliberated on an internal party investigation into her running of the city. DA leader Mmusi Maimane says the evidence presented, warrants further action against her. She will now face four charges in terms of the DA’s constitution. Maimane said: “She’s deliberately acted in a manner which impacts negatively on the image of the party. Fails to carry out his or her duties according to the standard of the federal council.” In the coming week, the DA will also be considering acting against de Lille for recent public statements it views as irresponsible and detrimental to the party. Maimane says de Lille acted in a manner that has negatively impacted on the image of the party. “We’ve determined that the FLC conclude their investigation expeditiously so that the matter can be brought to a resolution as soon as reasonably possible whilst at all times respecting procedural fairness and the dictates of national justice.”
