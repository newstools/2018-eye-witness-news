The Cape Town magistrates court on Tuesday learned of additional extortion charges. The accused were arrested in December last year and have been detained since then. Donning an ANC jacket, blue jeans and Louis Vuitton loafers, Nafiz Modack appeared alongside his four co-accused in the court. The defence has pleaded for bail application proceedings to be sped up. Investigating officer, Charl Kinnear, has explained how the men allegedly took over security operations at Cape Town’s popular Grand Africa Cafe and Beach. Modack’s lawyer played a voice recording between his client and a Grand Cafè employee in an attempt to highlight that no intimidation or extortion took place. Kinnear fears that if the accused are granted bail, they’ll intimidate witnesses and continue with their alleged illegal activity.
