                                         JOHANNESBURG - In their "new year's resolution" statement, African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts and veterans say for the party to achieve unity, President Jacob Zuma has to resign as leader of the country. The stalwarts shared their reflections for the party on the eve of the last day of 2017.  They congratulated Cyril Ramaphosa on his election as president of the ANC, saying he would not have an easy road, given the challenges the ANC faces.  Meanwhile, economists are hoping that the rand will continue to firm as the ruling party sorts out a number of issues.   The rand is 11% firmer compared to a year ago, ending 2017 at R12.35 to the dollar, compared to 2016's R13.74. The rand ended the year firmer after a volatile 12 months due to a number of key factors. Ratings agencies Moody's and S&P Global have warned that political uncertainty continues to weigh on the local currency. The Sunday Times reported that secret meeting were underway to discuss the future of President Zuma who has been hit by a series of legal blows, the latest being the Constitutional Court criticising the National Assembly for not taking action against him. Opposition parties have called for steps to be taken against the president before the State of the Nation Address in February. Traders also say that since Ramaphosa was elected president of the ANC, the rand has gained rather substantially against the greenback, making it one of the best performing emerging market currencies in December.
