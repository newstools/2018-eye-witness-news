The protest comes two days after groups of EFF supporters stormed H&M stores over a racist advert published by the Swedish retailer. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are protesting in front of the Mall of Africa H&M store on Monday afternoon. The reasons for the demonstration remain unclear. The protest comes two days after groups of EFF supporters stormed H&M stores  over a racist advert published by the Swedish retailer. The EFF remain unapologetic about their actions at H&M and say they will not be told how to protest racism. A man who was at the mall says there's a heavy police presence as a group of about 20 people protest in front of the H&M store. “The shops are closed and there’s a lot of security there. There’s a couple of police guys here and centre management is also present. They closed mainly all the shops on this level but they’re just dancing, they haven’t damaged anything. As I said security and the police are here.”
