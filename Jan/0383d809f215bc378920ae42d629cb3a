The report says that the motion to recall Zuma was raised by newly elected NEC member David Masondo and Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Bheki Cele. JOHANNESBURG - News24 is reporting that the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) currently meeting in Irene, Pretoria has debated a motion to recall President Jacob Zuma. The report says that the motion to recall Zuma was raised by newly elected NEC member David Masondo and Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Bheki Cele. Earlier, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule stressed that the recall of the president was not on the NEC agenda. The NEC is meeting for its first official lekgotla post the ANC’s 54th national conference, which saw Ramaphosa elected as the new party president. Magashule told reporters on the first day of the meeting in Irene Pretoria on Thursday that the newly elected leadership went through an induction process with the new national executive committee members. Magashule says top of the agenda for the leadership are plans for the year ahead, the 8 January statement, conference resolutions and racism in schools. He says there will be no talk of recalling Zuma. “It’s not an issue on the table. Remember we said in East London that there’s interaction between President Zuma and President Ramaphosa and that interaction will be continuing.” Magashule says he will vacate his position as premier of the Free State at the end of the financial year.
