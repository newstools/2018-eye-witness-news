There were more than 25,300 murders in Mexico last year, a 23% jump from 2016 and the highest number since at least 1997. CAPE TOWN - Mexico's soaring levels of drug-related violence have made 2017 the most murderous year on record. There were more than 25,300 murders in Mexico last year, a 23% jump from 2016 and the highest number since at least 1997, the year the government began tracking the data. Overall, murders in Mexico had been declining in recent years, reaching a low of more than 15,500 in 2014. But officials say a surge in drug-related crime has reversed that trend. Meanwhile, in 2017 crime stats reported more than 19,000 murders in South Africa.
