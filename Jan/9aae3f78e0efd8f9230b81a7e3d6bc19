                                         EAST LONDON - The African National Congress (ANC) has laid out its priorities for 2018, which include renewing the organisation and restoring its image in society, confronting corruption and state capture and appointing capable people in public office. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa  delivered the national executive committee’s January 8 Statement in East London on Saturday, with the central theme being unity. The ANC has laid down its wishlist for this year. Ramaphosa says first up on the list is working towards the renewal of the organisation. “We must work to restore the integrity and credibility of the African National Congress. “At the centre of our efforts this year is the issue of unity, it is the issue of unity- of how we can unite our movement. It is also the issue of fundamental renewal.” And then comes the economy. “We shall mobilise all social partners, in particular, government labour, business, behind the economic recovery plan that South Africa needs.” The party also wants to ensure those appointed in public office are capable. “To improve the transparency, to prevent undue influence and ensure adequate vetting of candidates.” Ramaphosa has also urged the party to start a fight against the plight of corruption. The party says it will also undertake measures to bring the ANC closer to the people.
