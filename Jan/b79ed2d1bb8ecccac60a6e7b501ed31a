The Syrian government says what the US administration has done comes in the context of its destructive policy in the region to fragment countries and impede any solutions to the crises. BEIRUT - The Syrian government denounced a new border force which the United States (US) is building with its militia allies in northern Syria as a “blatant assault” on sovereignty, state media said on Monday. “What the American administration has done comes in the context of its destructive policy in the region to fragment countries ... and impede any solutions to the crises,” state news agency SANA cited an official source in the ministry as saying. Two months ago, the US military said it would fight Islamic State in Syria “as long as they want to fight.” US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin affirmed joint efforts to stabilise Syria as its civil war wanes, including with the expansion of a 7 July truce in the southwestern triangle bordering Israel and Jordan. Russia, which has a long-term military garrison in Syria, said it wants foreign forces to quit the country eventually. Turkey said at the time the US had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The US-backed Syrian YPG Kurdish militia said Washington had established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The US-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces. One key aim for Washington is to limit Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq, which expanded during the war with Islamic State.
