A group of party supporters protested at H&M stores at the V&A Waterfront and Canal Walk on Saturday. CAPE TOWN - Provincial Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leaders are expecting to meet with H&M store management this week to discuss issues relating to an offensive advertisement. A group of party supporters protested at H&M stores at the V&A Waterfront and Canal Walk on Saturday. They demonstrated against a marketing campaign featuring a black boy modelling a hoodie with the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle”. The ad appeared on the British version of the retailer's online store. H&M stores locally have been temporarily closed following the incident on Saturday. EFF supporters protesting at the V&A Waterfront have refused to accept an apology issued by the H&M group.  The retailer issued a statement apologising for the poorly judged product and image. EFF Cape Metro regional cluster head Banzi Dambuza says he’s expecting to discuss transformation related issues during Wednesday's meeting. “We’ve demanded H&M that they must come and sit with us. They have given us a date themselves.”  The retailer says it’s dealing with an extremely serious, sensitive and volatile situation and will provide further updates at a later stage. A number of H&M stores in Gauteng were ransacked during the EFF supporters' demonstrations.
