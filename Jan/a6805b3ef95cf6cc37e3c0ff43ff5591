This comes after dozens of aggrieved members picketed outside the provincial headquarters earlier on Monday, dressed in pro-Cyril Ramaphosa regalia. DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal’s new interim African National Congress structure says its working to deal with all grievances raised internally to ensure a healthy environment ahead of the elective conference. This comes after dozens of aggrieved members picketed outside the provincial headquarters earlier on Monday, dressed in pro-Cyril Ramaphosa regalia. Some could also be seen carrying posters demanding 50/50 representation on the interim structure announced by secretary general Ace Magashule last week. Of the 16-member temporary committee, only four come from Senzo Mchunu’s camp. As the April deadline for the new elective conference looms, concerns have been raised by pro-Ramaphosa supporters about whether divisions will be resolved by then. Initially, demonstrators claimed to be picketing against the composition of the KZN interim structure, claiming its mainly made up of members from the suspended provincial elective conference. But after a closed-door meeting between the committee leaders and representatives of the disgruntled group, both say they have urgent issues to raise with the national working committee. Interim structure coordinator Sihle Zikalala said: “We briefed them that were going to meet them next week together with the NEC and we believe that the issues they’ve raised they will be able to take them with NEC members.” Both groups and a representative from the national executive committee are expected to meet next week.
