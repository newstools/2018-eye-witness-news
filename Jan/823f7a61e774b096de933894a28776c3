                                         BARCELONA - Barcelona signed midfielder Philippe Coutinho because they were given a significant discount on the price Liverpool were asking for him in the last transfer window, vice-president Jordi Mestre said on Monday. Coutinho became the third most expensive player in football history when he signed a five-and-a-half year contract with Barca on Monday following a €160 million deal between the clubs. Barcelona director Albert Soler said in September the club abandoned their pursuit of the Brazilian playmaker last year because Liverpool were asking for €200 million. “The club has always been interested in signing Coutinho, the difference to last summer is that there was a big cut in price,” Mestre told reporters on Monday at Coutinho’s official presentation. “We won’t state the numbers because Liverpool don’t want us to, but there was a big price cut.” Meanwhile, Coutinho will not be able to make his Barcelona debut for about three weeks because of a thigh injury he sustained while at Liverpool. The Brazilian playmaker passed a medical on Monday during which Barcelona doctors analysed the injury that kept him out of Liverpool’s Premier League win over Burnley on 1 January. “Coutinho has an injury in his right thigh. He will be out for 20 days,” Barcelona said in a statement, meaning he is likely to make his debut in the Catalan derby against Espanyol on 4 February.
