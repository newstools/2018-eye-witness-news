Allister Coetzee, in his a 19-page document, pinned the blame of his rocky two-year tenure on external factors out of his control. CAPE TOWN - Springbok coach Allister Coetzee has written an explosive letter to South African Rugby CEO Jurie Roux in which he attacks the games governing body. This is the clearest indication that Coetzee will no longer be the coach of the Springboks in 2018. The coach sent a 19-page document via his legal representatives to Roux which pinned the blame of his rocky two-year tenure on external factors out of his control. Rumours have been swirling around Coetzee’s position as head coach of the Springboks since December after two underwhelming years at the helm. In the letter, Coetzee alleges he was told his contract would be terminated at a meeting with Roux on 18 January and that newly appointed Director of Rugby Rassie Erasmus will coach the Springboks in 2018. Coetzee confirms he was offered a ceremonial role as Bok coach with Erasmus essentially in charge. As the coach, the team won 11 of its 25 Tests but has not yet had his performance review for last year. He’s blamed numerous external factors for poor results and alleges SA Rugby has set him up to fail and has embarked on a deliberate attempt to undermine him in an effort to create a public impression of incompetence. While the 54-year-old has not been formally axed, the letter is a clear indication that he might be in the near future.
