An interim structure was announced, which will now coordinate a new elective conference after the 2015 election was declared null and void. DURBAN - Dozens of pro-Senzo Mchunu and Cyril Ramaphosa supporters are demonstrating outside the Kwazulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC) headquarters, demanding the new provincial task team (PTT) be reconstituted. Members of the party’s top six, including ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, were in KwaZulu-Natal last week to meet with both factions after the provincial executive committee (PEC) was suspended by the national executive committee (NEC). An interim structure was announced, which will now coordinate a new elective conference after the 2015 election was declared null and void. Ramaphosa and Mchunu supporters are singing and chanting songs in their names, holding up posters saying: ‘We demand a more balanced PTT.’  Despite the ANC’s clarion call for unity, some demonstrators are still wearing Siyavuma T-shirts, which were worn during the campaign process. Of the 16-member provincial task team, four people come from the Ramaphosa faction.  The protestors are demanding 50/50 representation from both groupings. Meanwhile, a meeting is underway at the provincial ANC headquarters with task team convenor Mike Mabuyakhulu in attendance.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
