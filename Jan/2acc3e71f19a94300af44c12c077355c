                                         CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town high school is celebrating a 100% pass rate for several years running. Matriculants at Westerford High School have received their results. Provincial Education MEC Debbie Schäfer was there to congratulate the class of 2017. The Western Cape's pass rate sits at 84,4%, a 3% drop from the previous year. There were cheers of jubilation as anxious matriculants received their results.  Many could be seen comparing their scores while their parents embraced one another as celebrations got underway. The school had 178 matriculants last year. About 99,9% of them received bachelor entry passes. This student says she's relieved that the wait is finally over. “I did a lot better than I thought I would, so I am really excited. It’s just a special time. I didn’t think I could do it, but I put my mind to it and I did it.” Many of them say they plan on studying further at various tertiary institutions this year.
