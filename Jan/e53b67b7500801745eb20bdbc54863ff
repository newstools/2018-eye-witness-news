                                         JOHANNESBURG - Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have staged protests outside various H&M stores around Gauteng on Saturday afternoon over a monkey sweater advert. The retailer had used a black child to model a sweatshirt with the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle". H&M later removed the advert and apologised for any offence caused. EFF protestors have since left the H&M store in Sandton City. EFF members protesting outside the H&M store in Sandton were escorted out of the mall by police officers. A group of about 80 people wearing EFF t-shirts and red berets arrived at the mall on Saturday morning protesting over a racist advert by the company this week. The ad sparked a worldwide backlash and the EFF members here protesting say this is to show their grievance over the ad. Stores surrounding the H&M store like Woolworths closed their doors while the protestors were outside the H&M store. A small group remains outside the mall singing EFF songs.
