Former acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko says in a submission to the inquiry that he's part of a frantic campaign to break Eskom. CAPE TOWN - Former acting Eskom CEO Matshela Kokoâ€™s turn to defend himself against allegations of state capture at an inquiry in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon. WATCH: Parliament's Inquiry into state capture  His testimony follows that of former chief financial officer Anoj Singh who spent almost 12 hours before the inquiry on Tuesday after resigning on Monday. Koko, meanwhile, has not resigned. He says in a submission to the inquiry that he's part of a frantic campaign to break Eskom. Koko says he's been caught in the crossfire of the state capture narrative. In a written submission to the inquiry ahead of his appearance, he says Eskom's legal head Suzanne Daniels has told lies about him. He also claims she's played an instrumental role in his suspension last year. In fact, he says it's her who was pivotal to the R460 million in direct payments to consultants, Trillian. Koko further alleges that he's caught up in a media smear campaign fed by corrupt officials working at Medupi and Kusile power stations. They were the ones he says who blew the whistle on a R1 billion contract Eskom awarded to a company linked to his stepdaughter. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
