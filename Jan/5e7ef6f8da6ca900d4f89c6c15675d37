Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) says that Matshela Koko’s reinstatement at Eskom was ill conceived and he needs to resign. JOHANNESBURG - Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) is calling on Eskom employees to cooperate with investigations in an effort to renew the power utility. Eskom officials are testifying at the parliamentary inquiry into state capture this week and a special investigation unit has also been appointed to probe the utility. BLSA's Themba Maseko, however, says that Eskom executive Matshela Koko’s presence at the parastatal may compromise investigations. He says that Koko’s reinstatement was ill conceived and he needs to resign. "We believe that Matshela Koko's resignation will create space for the new board to appoint new executives at Eskom but will also enable the investigations to be conducted openly and frankly, without any interference from Koko."
