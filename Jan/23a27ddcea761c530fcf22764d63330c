Which protects young immigrants from deportation NEW YORK - The outcry over United States (US) President Donald Trump’s remarks  has overshadowed key issues facing the effort to protect young undocumented immigrants in the US. Trump, who drew sharp criticism since he was reported to have insulted Haiti and African countries while discussing immigration with lawmakers on Thursday, declared late on Sunday night that’s he’s not racist. Democrats have long been pushing to secure a deal for the Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as Daca. Which protects young immigrants from deportation. A program Trump has been trying to end since coming into office. On Monday Trump tweeted that it’s the fault of the Democrats that Daca has not progressed and is “probably dead”. Relations between key Republican and Democratic lawmakers have soured over whether Trump made the comment during last week’s meeting. Senator Dick Durbin says he did, while two other Republicans at the meeting say he didn’t.
