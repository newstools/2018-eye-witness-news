The DA's Federal Executive discussed on Tuesday whether action should be taken against them after they were asked last month to provide reasons why they should not resign. CAPE TOWN - In the fallout over Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille, the council's speaker Dirk Smit and the Democratic Alliance (DA) caucus whip Shaun August could face disciplinary charges in terms of the party's constitution. But they are not being asked to step down from their posts just yet. The DA's Federal Executive discussed on Tuesday whether action should be taken against them after they were asked last month to provide reasons why they should not resign, as part of an internal party investigation conducted by DA parliamentary whip, John Steenhuisen. DA spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said: “The federal executive discussed particularly the matters related to the speaker of the city of cape town and the chief whip and decided that the matter would be held pending the conclusion of a disciplinary process.”
