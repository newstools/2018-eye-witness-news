                                         JOHANNESBURG – It’s being reported that about 160 requests a day were made late in 2016 to access pornography websites from computers within the houses of parliament in the United Kingdom. According to Britain's Press Association (PA), the requests started in June 2017 around the time of the general elections. This comes as the discussion about an unhealthy culture of abuse by powerful men in British politics continues to swirl. Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May’s deputy, Damian Green, resigned. May said in a letter to Green that she had asked him to resign. Green denied an allegation that he made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman. Since then, David Lidington has appointed as Cabinet Office minister, a largely behind-the-scenes role supporting the prime minister and responsible for making sure the government runs smoothly. He replaces Green, but does not take on the additional title of First Secretary of State which made Green the de facto deputy to May. Additional reporting by Reuters. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
