The party ANC said that Dan Bovu had been charged with fraud and theft relating to a 2009 case in which he is alleged to have been involved in fraudulent activities while a member of the Thembelihle Trust. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg has confirmed that its regional deputy secretary will appear in the Johannesburg Commerical Cimes Court on charges of fraud and theft. The party, in a statement on Wednesday, said that Dan Bovu had been charged with fraud and theft at the Lenasia South Police Station on Wednesday relating to a 2009 case in which he is alleged to have been involved in fraudulent activities while a member of the Thembelihle Trust. According to the statement, it is alleged that a member of the public paid money into the trust's account and expected the trust to build a house for him. This, though, never happened. In 2015, after the matter resurfaced, the prosecuting authority dclined to prosecute due to a lack of evidence. The ANC's Jolidee Matongo says that the reason the case has resurfaced again is because Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and the Democratic Alliance coalition are pushing for Bovu to be charged and prosecuted. Matongo further says that Bovu informed the party of the case against him last week and has since offered to recuse himself from the ANC and City of Joburg activities while the case is before the court. The party says that it has agreed to give Bovu the space he needs to deal with the matter and clear his name. The party, however, says that it will deal with members "without fear or favour" if they have been found to have been involved in fraud and corruption.
