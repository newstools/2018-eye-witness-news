                                         NEW YORK - United States President Donald Trump has come under fire from some critics for the way he sang the national anthem at a college football game on Monday night.  Trump, who has been very vocal about urging respect for the anthem, attended the game in Atlanta. In video footage, President Trump can be seen with his hand over his heart as the Star-Spangled Banner begins to play but he doesn’t sing all of the words of the anthem. Some say he appears to have gotten part of the anthem wrong too. It’s an issue that's angered his critics because Trump has strongly criticised football stars who’ve knelt during the anthem  in protest over racial injustice and has previously insisted that players who don’t stand during the anthem should be fired or suspended.
