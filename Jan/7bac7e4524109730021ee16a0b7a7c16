JOHANNESBURG - Half-year profit at South African retailer Woolworths Holdings could fall by as much as 17.5%, it said on Monday, sending its shares down more than 9%.

Woolworths, which sells groceries, food and homeware, said headline earnings per share - the main gauge of profit in South Africa - was likely to fall between 12.5% and 17.5% or 200.1 cents and 212.3 cents in the six months to December 2017. Shares in Woolworths, similar in products and style to Britainâ€™s Marks and Spencer, fell as much as 9.2% after the announcement before paring losses. At 0852 GMT it was down 5.5% at R59.85. The retailer said group sales for the first half of the 2018 financial year increased by 2.5%, slower than a 6.7% rise in the first half of the 2017 financial year. Woolworths said in August, it plans to spend R2.1 billion in South Africa in 2018 and $250 million in Australia in its David Jones and Country Road clothing brands.
