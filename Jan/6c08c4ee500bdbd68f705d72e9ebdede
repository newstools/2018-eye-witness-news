Emmanuel Macron did not mention Donald Trump by name but joked that the heavy snowfall might lead some people to question climate change. DAVOS, Switzerland - French President Emmanuel Macron called at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Wednesday for a “global compact” to harness the negative effects of globalisation, warning against a race to the bottom on taxes and regulation. Speaking a day before Donald Trump arrives at the annual gathering in the Swiss Alps, Macron did not mention the president by name, but joked about the heavy snowfall, saying it might lead some people to question climate change. “Fortunately, you didn’t invite anybody skeptical of global warming this year,” Macron said to WEF founder Klaus Schwab, on the stage with him.
