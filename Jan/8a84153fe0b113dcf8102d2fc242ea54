The Democratic Alliance (DA) Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela signed an agreement with the KOP on Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has once again entered into a coalition with the Karoo Ontwikkelings Party (KOP) in the Laingsburg municipality. The Democratic Alliance (DA) Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela signed an agreement with the KOP on Wednesday. The two parties entered into a coalition after the 2016 local government election and produced a hung council. Last year, however, the alliance terminated and the KOP entered into an agreement with the African National Congress (ANC). But this didn't last either. Madikizela explains: “We started to talk behind the scenes of the possibility of working together again. We outlined the conditions that we would work together. We were working together under a new mayor. There’s a commitment to follow due processes and rules.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
