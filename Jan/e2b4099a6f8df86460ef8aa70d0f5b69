De Villiers sustained the injury to his right index finger during the third Sunfoil Test match against India. JOHANNESBURG- Proteas star batsman AB de Villiers has been ruled out of the first three One Day International matches against India, starting at Kingsmead in Durban on Thursday. De Villiers sustained the injury to his right index finger during the third Sunfoil Test match against India and will require up to two weeks to make a full recovery. The Proteas medical staff are, however, confident that he will return to action for the fourth ODI at the Wanderers, which will see South Africa don their pink kit.
