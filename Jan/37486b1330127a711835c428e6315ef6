CAPE TOWN - Desperate for water, thousands of increasingly panicked Capetonians are rushing to buy bottled water, water saving products and containers. Day Zero is fast approaching but where there's a looming disaster, at times, there's also usually a boom in business for some. Go to to virtually any plastics shop or hardware store and you're likely to encounter a virtual scrum for buckets, jerry cans and just about anything that can be used to store water. At a Mambo's Plastics Warehouse in Greenpoint employees can only assure customers they are constantly re-stocking. "We're getting stock today but I'm not sure when." A Builders Warehouse staffer told Eyewitness News that so-called Jojo tanks are sold out as quickly as they arrive. "We are totally out of stock of Jojo tanks and we're currently waiting on supplies." Shoprite supermarkets have seen a drastic increase in demand for bottled water. They say that there's been a 93% increase in sales over December and January compared to last year. Stores have sold over 3,2 million litres of bottled still and sparkling water over this period.
