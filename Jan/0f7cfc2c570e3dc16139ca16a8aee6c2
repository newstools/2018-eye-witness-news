                                         JOHANNESBURG - The United Democratic Movement (UDM) is warning of impending chaos at South African universities if President Jacob Zuma does not clarify how free education will be funded. On the eve of the African National Congress’ elective conference in December, the president announced that government would provide free education for students from poor and working-class households. Treasury has since said it's reviewing the details of the proposal as well as financing options. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says Zuma needs to announce the plan before universities reopen. “We expect the plan on how this is going to be done to be published.” The Democratic Alliance (DA) has also called on the Minister of Higher Education and Training to intervene in the registration processes at higher education institutions across the country, warning that the process is currently at risk of dissolving into chaos. 'UNIVERSITY REGISTRATION PROCESSES AT RISK' At the same time, the DA has called for Higher Education and Training Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize to intervene in the registration processes at tertiary institutions across the country. The party says the process is currently at risk of dissolving into chaos as a result of President Zuma’s reckless announcement and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)’s inflammatory calls. The EFF recently made a call to academically deserving students, saying that they should report to the universities of their choice to be enrolled. The DA’s Professor Belinda Bozzoli said: “There’s a very real threat having been issued by the EFF, which is students must just arrive for admission. This could be misleading thousands of students who might do so and find that they can’t be admitted.”
