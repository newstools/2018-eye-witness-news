Jacob Zuma is said to be planning a big bash at one of the top hotels in the city and word is that it is meant to be his official farewell dinner. ADDIS ABABA - President Jacob Zuma  is expected to jet into Addis Ababa in Ethiopia on Friday night for what could be his last foreign trip as South Africa's head of state. Zuma will be representing the country at the 30th African Union (AU) summit in the city, with the theme this year being: "Winning the fight against corruption". Officials and observers at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa all reckon this year's summit will be the last where the Zumas are present. Zuma is said to be planning a big bash at one of the top hotels in the city and word is that it is meant to be his official farewell dinner. Former AU Commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma bowed out at the same venue there 10 months ago. Back home, the governing African National Congress (ANC) has already started negotiations to secure Zuma's exit as head of state after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's election as ANC president last month. The AU summit already kicked off with meetings of officials, followed by a meeting of foreign ministers, set to end on Friday. The Heads of State Summit, where Zuma will represent South Africa, is scheduled to take place on Sunday and Monday. It will also be the first summit without Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe who was there when the AU's predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity, was first founded. Corruption, AU reforms, peace and security issues, as well as US president Donald Trump's recent derogatory remarks about African countries are all on the agenda at this summit.
