The organisation has labelled the evictions of over 600 people last year as illegal. JOHANNESBURG - Activist group the Right2Know Campaign is leading a picket outside the South Gauteng High Court, where the Marievale community in eastern Johannesburg is fighting its eviction from a run-down military base. The organisation has labelled the evictions of over 600 people last year as illegal, saying they were carried out without a court order and with no alternative accommodation for the families. The Right2Know Campaign Nntombiyebongo Tshabalala says: "The community of Marievale had to move. Again, they were evicted by the army. To this day they donâ€™t have accommodation. Other people decided to rent accommodation outside of Nigel." (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
