                                         JOHANNESBURG - Retail clothing store H&M used a black child to model a sweatshirt with the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle" and it did not sit well with all kinds of people. Canadian singer The Weeknd, real name Abel Tesfaye, expressed how “deeply offended” he is and has now cut ties with the retailer.  The singer began his association with H&M in 2017, modeling in ad campaigns and collaborating on pieces for his XO brand. He has since has dropped his association with fashion retailer. H&M has apologised and removed the offending ad from its website. The store’s spokesperson Anna Eriksson says that the company apologises to anyone who may have been offended. The apology has not been accepted as more celebrities have continued to express outrage. US basketball superstar, LeBron James,  blasted the retailer on his Instagram saying “@hm u got us all wrong! And we ain't going for it! Straight up!”  Diddy, now known as Love, asked H&M to respect black people.  H&M’S MARKETING MESS This is not the first time that the clothing store has found itself the centre of public backlash over a racist advert. When the retailer launched its first store in South Africa in 2015, it was criticised on Twitter for the lack of black models in its global marketing campaign. A Twitter user asked them why they don’t have black models on their posters to which they responded: “H&M has a major impact and it’s essential for us to convey a positive message.”  Twitter users were confused and offended by the response. The clothing retail store later apologised.
