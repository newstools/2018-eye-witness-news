                                         JOHANNESBURG - The rand was weaker in early trade on Wednesday, tracking a softer euro and British pound as the previous session’s brief gains gave way to bearish sentiment that has weighed on the currency for most of the week. At 0630 GMT the rand was 0.24% weaker at R12.3675 per dollar versus an overnight close of R12.3375 in New York. While the rand did reach a two-session best of R12.2775 briefly on Tuesday, gaining around 1% on rumours that President Jacob Zuma has stepped down, it quickly retreated to above R12.30. The currency has traded in a narrow range in the week, leaning towards losses as it retraced the sharp gains in the final weeks of 2017 that saw it race to 2-1/2 year highs, ignoring a weak local economic outlook to outshine its EM peers. Technical and momentum indicators also suggest the unit is due a selloff, while a rebound in demand for the dollar as lending rates there look set to rise has weighed on sentiment. In the short term, however, the rand could be swayed by political developments with the ruling African National Congress’s top decision-making body meeting from today and likely to decide Zuma’s fate. “The rand is definitely outperforming its peers which means that elastic band is tightening,” said chief trader at Standard Bank Warrick Butler in a note to investors. He added that a political outcome deemed negative by investors could see the fall as far as R12.80. Bonds were slightly weaker with the yield on the benchmark government paper due in 2026 up 1 basis point to 8.595%. Stocks were set to open slightly lower, in line with emerging market equities, with the futures index of benchmark Top-40 down 0.31%.
