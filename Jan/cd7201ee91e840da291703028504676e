                                         JOHANNESBURG- Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has moved up to number 1 bowler in the world in the ICC test rankings, following South Africa’s 72 run victory over India in the first Test at Newlands in Cape Town on Monday.  Rabada leapfrogged Englishman James Anderson to the summit of the test bowling rankings, following match figures of 5 for 75 against India.  Anderson who entered the 5th and final Ashes test match against Australia in Sydney as the number 1 bowler, dropped behind the 22-year-old Rabada by a single point. Rabada is the seventh South Africa bowler to top the ICC Test Bowling Rankings after Aubrey Faulkner, Hugh Tayfield, Peter Pollock, Shaun Pollock, Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander. Philander who took career best figures of 6/42 in India’s unsuccessful run chase in Cape Town has moved to 6th in the rankings, while opener Aiden Markram has jumped to 48th in the batting stocks, while Hashim Amla and Dean Elgar sit 10th and 16th respectively.  The second test between South Africa and India will start on 13 January at SuperSport Park in Centurion.
