The 42-year-old icon has been diligently working towards forming his side in Miami, Florida, for a number of years. LOS ANGELES - Former England captain David Beckham has confessed that his quest to launch his own soccer team has been "painful". The 42-year-old icon has been diligently working towards forming his side in Miami, Florida, for a number of years, but he's confessed that the long-winded process has been tiresome at times. Beckham - who previously played for the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer - shared: "It's been painful at times. I'm a persistent person. I don't like to lose." Beckham and his business partners plan to fund the construction of a 25,000-seat stadium in Miami's Overtown neighbourhood. The investment group has been forced to explore various different proposed sites for the new stadium - but Beckham has insisted Overtown will definitely be the future home of MLS in Miami. He told Channel 10 in Miami: "This is our site. This is a site we have paid for. This is a site we plan on using." Despite this, Beckham recently claimed that he and his wife, singer-turned-designer Victoria Beckham, are "saving the pennies" these days. The world-famous couple already has millions of pounds to their name but instead of buying extravagant gifts for themselves, the Beckhams are determined to save for their children - Brooklyn, 18, Romeo, 15, Cruz, 12, and Harper Seven, six. Beckham previously said: "We used to be very extravagant in what we'd buy each other. But we're obviously saving the pennies now because we have so many children to be extravagant ... So it's the simple things, really." Although the Beckhams have the riches to live an extravagant lifestyle, the retired soccer star - who played for the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid during his sports career - insisted that's not his motivation. He said: "It's more about spending time together, going for a simple dinner together. Having a nice bottle of wine together."
