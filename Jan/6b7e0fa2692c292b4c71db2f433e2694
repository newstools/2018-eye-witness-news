The decision follows a host of allegations of maladministration against Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille. She has denied the claims. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance has announced that its federal executive has recommended that Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille be formally charged and investigated by its legal commission for acting in a manner that has negatively affected the image of the party. DA leader Mmusi Maimane has briefed the media on a federal executive meeting on de Lille's fate on Sunday afternoon. Maimane says de Lille made misleading and distorting public statements. Maimane says her remarks have been deeply disappointing. “It would seem that the mayor has interfered with and manipulated appointments at senior management level within the city and some of its entities. A growing sense of a loss of confidence by the caucus in the leadership of the mayor which affected governance in the city negatively and undermined effective service delivery.” Maimane says there is clear evidence of divisive, autocratic leadership style which has created a paralysing culture of fear. Late last year allegations surfaced that de Lille had allegedly misused city funds to pay for upgrades at her private residence. She has denied the claims. De Lille and Mayoral Committee member JP Smith  were also embroiled in a public spat  over the closure of the city’s special investigating unit. Since then, the accusations of maladministration have further stacked up against de Lille. In an explosive affidavit in which the executive director in her office, Craig Kesson, alleges that she’s been ignoring tender corruption within the city’s transport authority.
