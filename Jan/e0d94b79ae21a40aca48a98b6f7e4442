WATCH: #KrugersdorpShutdown: Foreign nationals targeted  Residents did not mince their words when they raised their concerns. “When I called the police, they told me there are no vans. They are protecting the criminals who are foreign nationals. The police are always conducting raids when there’s a complaint, they go into a dirty place and come out clean.” Others who spoke also wanted Mbalula to address the issue of foreign nationals who sell drugs in the area. Mbalula says he has heard their pleas. “I want these people you are talking about arrested.” He says he supports the residents’ campaign but condemns the destruction of property.
