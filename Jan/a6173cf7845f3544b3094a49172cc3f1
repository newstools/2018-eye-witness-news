                                         JOHANNESBURG- Test cricket’s number 1 bowler, Kagiso Rabada says he wants to keep getting better after he was announced as the number 1 bowler in test cricket by the International Cricket Council on Tuesday. Rabada’s match figures of 5 for 75 helped the Proteas complete a 72 run victory against India in the first test at Newlands in Cape Town and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.  “It feels great to be at the top of the rankings,” Rabada said on Wednesday. “It is what I have always wanted to do, hopefully, I can keep doing what I’m doing and keep trying to win games for the team. I want to keep getting better and better." “There is always something new that you can work on,” he said of his skill. “That is how I have felt in my career so far, there is always a problem. Even those skills that I have, there is always polishing that you must do, I’m not 100% accomplished in my skills, I have to do more and more. I’m striving for perfection, you are never going to reach perfection but I can at least try getting there and thereabout.”  The second test match against India gets underway on the 13th of January at SuperSport Park in Centurion.
