JOHANNESBURG - Springbok Sevens captain Philip Snyman and the experienced Ruhan Nel have returned to South Africa following injuries sustained at the Sydney Sevens tournament last weekend. The Boks made it to the final of the competition before being convincingly beaten by the home team Australia. They do however go back to the top of the overall standings. Snyman and Nel will be replaced this weekend by SA Rugby Sevens Academy products Zain Davids and Muller du Plessis. Davids, played in six tournaments for the Blitzboks last season, while Du Plessis will be the reserve player for the tournament. The experienced Kyle Brown takes over the captaincy from the injured Snyman. Coach Neil Powell says that Davids’ form for the Academy made him an obvious choice to replace the injured duo in the squad ahead of the New Zealand leg of the tournament starting on 3 February. “Zain has done really well in the three tournaments in the Academy squad in Dubai, also it’s a straight swap, tight head for tight head as Philip Snyman and Zain both play in the position.” The New Zealand leg features a new venue this year, with Hamilton replacing Wellington as the host venue.
