Vardy, who was brought down in the Watford box as he looked to skip past Malian defender Molla Wague, picked himself up to neatly place his shot past goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis and give his side the lead in the 39th minute. LONDON - A well-taken first-half penalty from striker Jamie Vardy and an injury-time goal from midfielder Riyad Mahrez gave Leicester City a 2-0 win over Watford in an entertaining Premier League game on Saturday. Vardy, who was brought down in the Watford box as he looked to skip past Malian defender Molla Wague, picked himself up to neatly place his shot past goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis and give his side the lead in the 39th minute. Mahrez then slotted past Karnezis, who replaced the injured Heurelho Gomes, in the first minute of added time as Watford pushed bodies forward in search of an elusive equaliser. Watford’s best chance fell to substitute Andre Gray in the 74th minute but the striker’s fierce shot from inside the box was blocked by Leicester defender Harry Maguire.
