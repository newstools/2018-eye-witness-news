The party's federal executive has given its legal commission 60 days to deal with four charges against her for bringing the party into disrepute. CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille says she welcomes a decision by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to formally charge in relation to maladministration in the city. The party's federal executive has given its legal commission 60 days to deal  with four charges against her for bringing the party into disrepute. During this time, de Lille will continue to lead the city, but her deputy Ian Neilson will now be charged with taking over the management of the city's water crisis. De Lille says she's dedicated her life to fighting corruption and she feels that Sunday's decision by the DA will afford her the opportunity to present her side of the story. “It is disappointing that it took them so long. It is also disappointing that they are already stripping me of my powers, which they are not allowed to do in terms of my statutory duties before the disciplinary process has been concluded.”
