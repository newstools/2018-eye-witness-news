At the master plan workshop, it called on the public to make online and written submissions by 31 January with suggestions on how to improve services. “What we working towards is getting the first draft available for Cabinet by 14 March this year. Once Cabinet endorses the first draft we will take that for further engagement.” The department did not address the water crisis in Cape Town.
