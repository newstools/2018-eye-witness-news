The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee announced a strong South African squad for the Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4-15 April 2018. JOHANNESBURG- The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) announced a strong South African squad for the Commonwealth Games on Australia’s Gold Coast from 4-15 April 2018. The squad comprises of Aquatics, Athletics, Badminton, Cycling, Hockey, Lawn Bowls, Para Lawn Bowls, Netball, Rugby Sevens, Triathlon, Wrestling and Para Table Tennis squads that will be going Down Under for the prestigious Games. The notable exclusion from the team going to Australia, is sprinter and 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk in the athletics team, as he is still recovering from a knee injury he sustained while playing in a celebrity touch rugby game late in 2017. SASCOC President Gideon Sam says that it took a lengthy process in choosing the team that will represent South Africa at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia. “As SASCOC, we’re very excited to deliver this team for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games” “Many hours of planning have gone into preparing this team.” Sam also says that it is important that the Commonwealth Games are taken as a platform for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo Japan. “Two years out from     the Tokyo Olympics, these Games are a great platform to see where our sportsmen and women, both established and developing, are on the world stage.” The Aquatic team is the biggest in terms of numbers, with 28 athletes selected, (23 swimmers, 3 divers, and two para swimmers) including Chad le Clos and Cameron van der Burgh. Aquatics boasts the two youngest members of the team, in the form of Luan Grobbelaar and Dune Coetzee, both aged 15 while lawn bowler Princess Schreuder, at 67, is the oldest competitor in the team. Athletics stars Caster Semenya, Luvo Manyonga, and Akani Simbine have all made the athletics team.
