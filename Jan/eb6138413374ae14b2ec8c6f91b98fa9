                                         EAST LONDON - ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has used his first delivery of the NEC’s January 8 Statement to talk tough on corruption and state capture, as well as clarifying President Jacob Zuma’s announcement of free education. Ramaphosa addressed supporters at Absa Stadium in East London in the Eastern Cape where the ANC is celebrating its 106 years of existence. Ramaphosa’s speech centered around the need for unity in the ANC.  He also took time to address the issue of free education and funding for it. “The programme will be implemented on a gradual basis as we find money as we mobilise resources.”  Ramaphosa also focused on corruption saying the party will tackle it head-on. “Corruption and collusion in the private sector must be fought with equal diligence.”  Another central issue is state capture, he has called on law enforcement agencies to be at the forefront of investigating it. “This commission will take us to the bottom of what is happening, and we say thank you for it.” Despite calling out ANC members for booing Zuma, the crowd continued to boo the former ANC president every time his name was mentioned.
