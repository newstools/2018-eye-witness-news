JOHANNESBURG - Organisers of the Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon and the Cape Town Cycle Tour are doing their bit to save water while maintaining the quality of the events. The two events are eager to comply with the stringent water restrictions set out by the City of Cape Town to avoid Day Zero, the day that the city's taps run dry. No municipal water will be used at any of the OMTOM events, as water for race day has been sourced from the Newlands spring with an allocated and approved dispensation from relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Water and Sanitation. This project has been in the works and race planning for over three months. The purified spring water will be distributed to all participants via sachets and other water delivery systems. Some runners will use hydration packs to fill up at the start of the race instead of using their daily household allowance, while refill stations for hydration packs will be positioned along the Ultra Marathon route. There will also be no showers permitted at the end of the races. All chemical toilets brought to the various race sites will use only certified recycled water. The University of Cape Town (UCT) will close all taps at the finish area, while the fixed showers at UCT will be inaccessible. Carol Vosloo, General Manager of the Two Oceans Marathon non-profit company, says that they have set out a detailed action plan on complying with the water restrictions. “We have developed a comprehensive action plan and are implementing a range of water-saving and alternative water-sourcing initiatives that will restrict usage of our most scarce and endangered resource”
