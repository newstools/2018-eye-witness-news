JOHANNESBURG- The injury ravaged Proteas ODI squad has suffered another setback, with wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock ruled out of the rest of the limited overs series against India with a wrist injury. The Proteas are 2-0 down in the six-match ODI series, with India claiming crushing victories in the first two ODI’s in Durban and Centurion. Injuries have plagued South Africa, as a number of senior players like captain Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers already missing from the line-up, and the nine-wicket loss in Centurion in the second match saw 23-year-old Aiden Markram deputizing as captain for the rest of the series. Wicketkeeper batsman, Quinton de Kock, has now also been ruled out of the limited overs series. De Kock will miss the remaining four ODI’s and the entire T20 International series due to a left wrist injury. He suffered the injury during the second ODI in Centurion and will be sidelined for a period of between two to four weeks. The Proteas medical team are confident that De Kock will be fit to face the Australians when they arrive for their four-match Test series. Proteas team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee described De Kock’s injury as a bony left wrist injury. “Quinton suffered an extreme blow to the left wrist while batting in the second ODI on Sunday and felt severe pain and discomfort. Further investigation revealed severe bony bruising to the area, with associated swelling around the tendon in the wrist. This type of injury will require between 2-4 weeks to heal.” The third ODI will take place on Wednesday at Newlands in Cape Town, with the Proteas looking to register their first win in the series.
