Baroka FC resigned Cape Town City to their fourth successive defeat and 10th loss of the Absa Premiership season with two goals from winger Mpho Kgaswane at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. JOHANNESBURG- Baroka FC condemned Cape Town City FC to their fourth successive defeat and 10th loss of the Absa Premiership season with two goals from winger Mpho Kgaswane at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. City were the dominant side in the contest but wasted plenty of opportunities in front of goal, while the hosts scored from their two chances on goal. The first chance for City came as early as the first minute when Judas Mosemadi's chip came off the Baroka goal posts. City kept on pressing for an opener with Lyle Lakay finding space on the edge of the box but his shot went inches wide from goal. Baroka and Kgaswane made City rue those missed chances in the 34th minute with a thunderous freekick routine from the training ground to put them in the lead going into the half time break. The visitors started the second half pushing even harder for an equalizer. They went on a swift counter-attacking move on the right-hand flank through Lakay and Thamsanda Mkhize and when the ball eventually fell at Shane Roberts' feet, he blasted wide of goal from close range. Kgaswane then put the final nail in Cityâ€™s coffin a minute from regular time through a beautiful counter-attack. He drilled his low shot passed Walters to give Baroka the win. The win moves Baroka to six and leap frog City who slip down to 7th.
