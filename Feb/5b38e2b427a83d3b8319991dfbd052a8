The restaurant had become a place to go to get Mrs Balls Chutney or chakalaka or just to hear a friendly ‘howzit’ for many expats. NEW YORK - A South African restaurant in New York has closed its doors after 19 years. The much-loved Madiba restaurant in Brooklyn, which made headlines for banning Donald Trump from eating there when he was running for president, has served its last meal. Whether it was to watch the World Cup or to mourn the passing of Nelson Mandela, Madiba, named after the late president, became a home away from home for many expats. A place to go to get Mrs Balls Chutney or chakalaka or just to hear a friendly ‘howzit’. In recent years, the restaurant has battled to afford its rent in the gentrifying area of Fort Greene in Brooklyn, forcing it to now shut its doors much to the dismay of its loyal patrons. But owner Mark Henegan has hinted he hopes to open a new venture for South Africans in New York City in the future. Henegan says he opened the restaurant with the hope of keeping Mandela’s legacy going in the US, for others to follow. “Somebody that went to jail for what he believed in, became president of South Africa. Could you imagine being in that moment in that time, coming out of prison and becoming a president? It’s almost crazy.” Other local dishes that were served in the New York-based restaurant include bobotie, pap & vleis, mngqusho, and malva pudding. Brooklyn was the first place Madiba went on his first visit to NYC, which was also his first to the US, upon being released from prison. Henegan himself was told he was crazy to open up Madiba, as a white man in what was then a predominantly black area that had a problem with drugs.
