JOHANNESBURG - China has denied reports that it spied on the African Union (AU) summit which took place last week. China, which built and paid for the AU's computer network, allegedly inserted a backdoor allowing it access to the continental organisation's confidential information. The union's information technology team claims that data from the AU building was being copied to Shanghai. Speaking in Cape Town on Sunday, Chinese ambassador Lin Songtian has denied these reports, saying China is willing to continue to work with the African continent. “And now wherever you go around the continent you can see the projects built and financed by China. Today, we are very proud to say that China stands Africa’s largest trading partner. No one compares to us.”
