The firm says it has refrained from making comments but after MultiChoice's statement on its decision not to renew its contract with ANN7, it now needs to clarify a few things. E-media Investments says in an attempt to justify payments to the Gupta-linked channel, MultiChoice CEO Calvo Mawela told reporters annual payments to e.TV had escalated substantially, heading towards R500 million per annum.
