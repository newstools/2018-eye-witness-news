A Times Live report says after losing the battle for presidency at the ANC elective conference last year, Ddlamini-Zuma would be handing in a letter of resignation soon. But the former African Union chairperson took to Twitter to call out the alleged 'fake news', adding that as someone who crossed borders by foot to join the arms struggle to be tired out by Parliament cannot be true. She also added that she does not quit.  WHAT'S NEXT FOR DLAMINI-ZUMA?
