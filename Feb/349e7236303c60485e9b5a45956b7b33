JOHANNESBURG- South African Long Jump star Luvo Manyonga set a new national indoor long jump record at the Paris Indoor Meeting on Wednesday night. Manyongaâ€™s inspirational story is well documented, from beating a drug addiction to a silver medal in the Olympics in Brazil in 2016. The Cape Town-born making his indoor debut, landed at 8.32m with his penultimate attempt of the night to secure a comfortable victory ahead of Greek athlete Miltiadis Tentoglou who took second place with a 7.89m jump. Manyonga bettered the previous South African record of 8.18m, which had been set by former Olympic silver medalist Khotso Mokoena in Paris in February 2007 and equaled by World Championships bronze medalist Ruswahl Samaai in Portland in March 2016.
