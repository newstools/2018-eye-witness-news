ANC members and “defenders of Luthuli House” group have condemned the assault of the woman during Monday’s clash between ANC and BLF members. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says a member seen assaulting a woman at a protest outside Luthuli House will face a disciplinary process hastily. ANC members and the so-called “defenders of Luthuli House” group have condemned the assault of the woman during Monday’s clash between ANC and Black First Land First (BLF) members. A video of the confrontation between the two groups shared on social media has drawn angry reactions. A video showing a man wearing an ANC t-shirt kicking a woman who had fallen during the scuffle between the ANC and BLF has angered many on social media. Organiser of the “defenders of Luthuli House” Mkhululi White says the attack takes away from their peaceful protest. “What that comrade did was very wrong and must be condemned in the strongest term and also we hope that the law enforcement will deal with that comrade because he was not part of the organisers, he’s a person who joined the march.” The ANC in Johannesburg has also condemned the assault describing it as utterly disgusting. Rights group Not in My Name says the ANC member will face legal action. In a statement condemning the attack, the ANC has named the man as Thabiso Setona. Not in My Name's Themba Masango said: “One, we are going to be engaging the ANC Johannesburg region to get rid of this guy out of the branch. Two, make sure that legal action is taken against him because no matter how right your cause may seem to be in your eyes, you have no right to beat up a woman, especially unprovoked.” The clash broke out during opposing protests over President Zuma's political future which is the topic of this afternoon's national working committee meeting of the ANC.
