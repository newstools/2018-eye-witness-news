SA Rugby and SuperSport said radio played a critic role in informing the millions of rugby fans in the country. JOHANNESBURG- Sports broadcaster SuperSport and SA Rugby have agreed to waive radio broadcast rights fees for Vodacom Super Rugby for the SABC. The announcement comes after the national broadcaster revealed a few days ago that it was facing financial constraints to acquire the rights to broadcast live Super Rugby matches on its radio channels. SA Rugby President Mark Alexander and Chief Executive of SuperSport Gideon Khobane said that radio played a critic role in informing the millions of rugby fans in the country. “The fear that rugby commentary might no longer be a feature of our listening experience is a very real and a very worrying one and I’d like to commend SuperSport for the leadership they have shown in this matter. “I trust that the SABC will now be able to reassure listeners that rugby commentary on Vodacom Super Rugby, Currie Cup and Springbok Test matches will be a feature of their 2018 schedules.” Said Alexander. Khobane said that waiving the rights to SABC wasn’t a difficult decision to make. “Frankly, it wasn’t a difficult discussion,”
