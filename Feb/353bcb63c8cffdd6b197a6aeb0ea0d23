First Lady Thobeka Madiba-Zuma posted a picture of herself and Jacob Zuma saying 'It’s going get rough, don’t fight with someone who is not fighting you'. JOHANNESBURG - As President Jacob Zuma faces pressure from all sides to resign before the weekend, one of his wives Thobeka Madiba-Zuma has come out in his defense. Madiba-Zuma is known for her love of social media especially Instagram where pictures of herself and President Zuma dominate her page. She posted a picture of herself and Zuma on Friday referring to him as her everyday crush, saying: “Kuzoshuba ungalwi nomuntu ongalwi nawe”, which loosely translated means: “It’s going get rough, don’t fight with someone who is not fighting you”. She also responded to a comment on the picture, saying "Zuma did not join the ANC in 1991, jumped ship or hip-hopped between the struggle and wealth accumulation". She ended the comment with: “Zuma will finish what he started because he doesn’t take orders beyond the Atlantic Ocean” My everyday crush, Nxamalala Msholozi Maphumephethe Inkunzi Emidwayidwa Zinyane likaMnyakanya.
