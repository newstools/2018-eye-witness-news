President Ramaphosa arrived at the Gugulethu Sports Complex for his early morning walk. CAPE TOWN - In a bid to prove he’s fit for office, President Cyril Ramaphosa is promoting a healthy lifestyle by walking from Gugulethu to Athlone. He arrived at the Gugulethu Sports Complex early on Tuesday morning. He is also expected to respond to a debate on his State of the Nation Address in the National Assembly on Tuesday.   Ramaphosa won’t be alone during his morning walk. A jovial crowd of people, many donning their running gear, gathered at the sports complex. They will be hitting the tar with the president. Last week, he was snapped while out on a morning stroll with former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel at the Sea Point promenade hours after President Jacob Zuma’s resignation. He was also spotted walking at the East London beachfront days before delivering the ANC’s 8 January statement. Ramaphosa’s casual public appearances could be seen as reminder of the days of Nelson Mandela, who would think nothing of interacting with people. This is a departure from former president Jacob Zuma who’d rarely venture outdoors without his security detail.   (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
