SA Rugby has confirmed the sacking of coach Allister Coetzee with immediate effect. CAPE TOWN - SA Rugby announced on Friday that it had reached an agreement with Allister Coetzee to part ways with immediate effect, ending his tenure as Springbok coach after two years. The news comes off the back of a leaked document where Coetzee accused SA Rugby of setting him up to fail, which was indicated a strained relationship between the coach and the rugby body. It was expected that Coetzee would not be the coach in 2018 after managing just 11 wins in his 25 Tests in charge. His record includes a first time loss to Italy and record losses New Zealand. The Rugby Department of SA Rugby will manage the responsibilities of the Springbok coach, until the national team’s coaching and management group for 2018 is confirmed later this month. SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux says the move is in the best interests of the Springboks, while thanking Coetzee for his dedication and passion. "First and foremost, we had to assess what is in the best interests of the Springboks. "We’d like to thank Allister for his passion and dedication to the Springbok cause and wish him every success in his next role," said Roux. Coetzee said that he will always hold Springbok rugby close to his heart. "I have always held Springbok rugby dear to my heart and will continue to do so and for that reason I think now is the time the team and me strike out in new directions. I wish Springbok rugby every success in the future – as I have always done." The confirmation of the new coach and Springbok management set-up is due to be completed before the end of February.
