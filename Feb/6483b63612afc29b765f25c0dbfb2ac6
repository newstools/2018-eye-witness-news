Transparency International has found the world is making little to no progress in fighting corruption. PRETORIA - Transparency International's (TI) latest report reveals that crackdowns on the media and non-governmental organisations are usually associated with higher levels of corruption. The 25-year-old Berlin-based watchdog has found that most countries are moving too slowly in their efforts to fight corruption. Transparency International Annual Corruption Perceptions Index is criticised because it reduces the level of a country’s graft to a single figure. It can, out of necessity, be based on reality which is most often officially obscured. This year, TI finds the world is making little to no progress in fighting corruption while journalists and activists risk their lives daily in their efforts to speak out. The organisation’s supporters say its work succeeds in keeping the issue on official radars.   WATCH: Corruption Perceptions Index 2017 | Transparency International
