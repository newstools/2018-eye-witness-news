Minister Lynne Brown says South Africans have a reason to be proud of the progress the country has made in adding renewable energy to the supply mix. JOHANNESBURG - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has approved Eskom’s application for additional renewable energy from independent power producers. Brown says South Africans have a reason to be proud of the progress the country has made in adding renewable energy to the supply mix. There were several delays in signing the power purchase agreements, a programme driven by Treasury and the Energy Department and allegedly hamstrung by Eskom’s unwillingness to buy power from independent producers. Brown says she has requested that Eskom works expediently to implement the decision to go ahead with power purchase agreements and avoid further delays. The delay was largely due to Eskom citing concerns about the cost of renewable energy and the current oversupply of electricity. But Members of Parliament had challenged this, saying Eskom wants to go ahead with a nuclear build programme, which costs far more than renewable energy. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa recently stated that South Africa simply cannot afford nuclear at this stage. Meanwhile, Eskom’s new board and acting CEO have vowed to turn things around at the state-owned entity, saying one of the first priorities is to boost investor confidence and raise funds for the cash-strapped utility.
