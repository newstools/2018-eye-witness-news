KZN remains an important area ahead of next year’s elections, with the provincial DA hoping to weaken the African National Congress (ANC)'s power and potentially piggyback on its current divisions. DURBAN - As the Democratic Alliance (DA) prepares to hold its KwaZulu-Natal provincial congress on Saturday, one contender for provincial leader has been accused of being a “black puppet”, campaigning on behalf of white conservatives. KZN remains an important area ahead of next year’s elections, with the provincial DA hoping to weaken the African National Congress (ANC)'s power and potentially piggyback on its current divisions. With the national DA itself facing divisions and in-fighting, KwaZulu-Natal has not been exempt, with the top two contenders supported by opposing factions. Current KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango is running for a second time and is seen to have the backing of the party’s so-called black caucus, including Solly Msimanga and Herman Mashaba. Mncwango says that his main focus is tomorrow's congress. "I'm not part of any caucus, I'm part of the DA." Relative unknown Emmanuel Mhlongo will run against Mncwango. He strongly denies claims that he is a proxy of white conservatives in the party. "And my real problem is that we cannot use racism in our campaign and we cannot really say that there are people who are conservative in this party." Both contenders have mixed views on recent comments by former DA leader Tony Leon, who’s called on members to support ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa in his fight against corruption.
