Preparations get underway on Tuesday with the first of three four-day training camps taking place in Stellenbosch. JOHANNESBURG - The Junior Springboks are set to undergo a rigorous preparation process ahead of the World Rugby U20 Championship in France starting at the end of May. The build to the showpiece event will see Chean Rouxâ€™s men go through four training camps and a UK tour to ensure they are at the top of their game for the World Cup. Preparations get underway on Tuesday with the first of three four-day training camps taking place in Stellenbosch, the last of which will conclude at the end of March. The 43-man squad will then have a two-week camp in April before a UK tour in May with internationals against the likes of Georgia, Scotland, Wales and England thrown into the mix. Roux said: "This preparation schedule is ideal to ensure that we arrive in France well prepared both mentally and physically for the U20 Championship. "By having four-day camps in February and March we will also avoid a situation where the FNB Varsity Cup players miss a few days of training due to their team commitments." The training squad includes five capped Junior Springboks: Salmaan Moerat, Gianni Lombard, Wandisile Simelane, Rewan Kruger and Muller Uys. Roux added that there will be chances for players outside of the current group to play their way into the training squad. "We will continue to keep an eye on other players who perform well, so the group could change as our preparations continue."
