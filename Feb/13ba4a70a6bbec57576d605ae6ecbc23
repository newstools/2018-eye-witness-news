LONDON - Matt Ritchie lifted the gloom on Tyneside with the winner in Newcastle United’s crucial 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday their first three-point haul at home since October. Newcastle had fallen into the bottom three before kickoff after Huddersfield Town’s earlier win over Bournemouth, but they responded with a vibrant display capped by Ritchie’s 65th minute effort. Ritchie was released into space by Dwight Gayle’s flick and he buried a low shot past David de Gea. Gayle was also unlucky not to be awarded a first-half penalty but Man United were guilty of wasteful finishing with Anthony Martial and Alexis Sanchez the chief culprits. The visitors almost grabbed a stoppage-time equaliser but debutant goalkeeper Martin Dubravka made a marvellous low save after the ball deflected off one of his own players from close range. Newcastle’s first win over United for five years lifted them from 18th to 13th while Jose Mourinho’s second-placed side are now 16 points behind local rivals Manchester City and looking over their shoulders at the teams behind them. Mourinho has never won a fixture at St James’ Park in seven visits, drawing three and losing four.
