On Tuesday, he is walking five kilometres from the Gugulethu Sports Complex to Athlone Stadium. The walk is expected to start at 5.30 am. The African National Congres's Yonela Diko says: “The purpose of this walk is to encourage communities from the Cape Town metro, around the townships, to embark on a healthier lifestyle.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
