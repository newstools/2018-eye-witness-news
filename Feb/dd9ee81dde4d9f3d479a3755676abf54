JOHANNESBURG - Desiree Ellis will take on her first assignment as the full-time head coach of the South African Women’s side when they face Slovakia in their first match of the Cyprus Women’s Cup on Wednesday. Ellis was confirmed as the head coach of the Women’s side after 18 months acting in the role after Vera Pauw vacated the position in 2016. The South African Football Association made the announcement a day before jetting off to Cyprus. Banyana Banyana face Slovakia, Hungary and Trinidad and Tobago in Group C, while the competition also features the likes of Italy, Belgium and Spain. Former Banyana Banyana captain Amanda Dlamini believes that the Cyprus Cup is a great opportunity for Banyana to gain international experience in preparation for the World Cup qualifiers. “This is a critical stage for Banyana with the World Cup qualifiers around the corner, so it is important to play in competitions like the Cyprus Cup because it exposes us to playing against European sides.” Banyana’s clash against Slovakia is set to kick off at 1pm.
