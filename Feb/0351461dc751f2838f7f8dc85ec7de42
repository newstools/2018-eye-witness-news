The Athletics Grand Prix Series consists of three meetings - Ruimsig Stadium, Johannesburg on 1 March 2018, Tuks Stadium, Tshwane on 08 March 2018 and at the Dal Josaphat Stadium, Paarl on 22 March 2018. Cheptegei will be seen in action at the first two meetings and is no stranger to South Africa. He won the inaugural FNB Durban 10km City Surf Run in October last year, when he ran the fourth fastest time in the world for 10km and set a new All Comers Record of 27:28 for the distance. The 21-year-old Cheptegei says that he wants to use the Grand Prix Series to improve his running times. “I want to run a time of around 3:32 on 1 March. I need to improve my speed for my specialist events, the 5,000m and 10,000m. The 1,500m is perfect for that.”
