Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille wants the court to order a secret ballot be held when council debates a motion of no confidence in her. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA)’s federal executive has denied it ever instructed Cape Town councillors to vote in a particular way. The party was responding to a High Court application by Mayor Patricia de Lille. She wants the court to order a secret ballot be held when council debates a motion of no confidence in her later in February. The DA’s federal chairperson James Selfe says they have noted the mayor’s court application and will discuss the matter further with their lawyers on Friday. Selfe says as far as a secret ballot is concerned, the party has no power to decide. “The rules of the Cape Town City Council are very clear that the council itself needs to decide on the matter. It has nothing to do with the Democratic Alliance.” Council is expected to debate a motion of no confidence in De Lille on 15 February. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
