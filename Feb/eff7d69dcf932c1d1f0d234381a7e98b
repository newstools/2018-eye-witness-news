Cosatu and the SACP seem to be concerned about about Cyril Ramaphosa's lengthy talks with President Jacob Zuma. CAPE TOWN - As Cyril Ramaphosa and President Jacob Zuma cancel their engagement to seemingly finalise talks regarding Zuma’s removal, the party’s alliance partners are calling on the ANC president to be decisive and make sure Zuma is not president by the end of this weekend. On Thursday, the ANC cancelled Ramaphosa’s engagements for two days, saying that he has pressing issues to deal with. This while the Ubuntu awards, which Zuma was meant to officiate at on Saturday, has also been cancelled. Meanwhile, the ANC has a hectic schedule on Friday, where it’s top leaders, except Ramaphosa and Gwede Mantashe, will participate in activities in the Western Cape as the party prepares to launch its celebrations of the centennial year in honour of late former President Nelson Mandela. The SACP and Cosatu were at the forefront of Cyril Ramaphosa’s support ahead of the party’s elective conference in December. They seem to be concerned about his lengthy talks with President Jacob Zuma. Cosatu’s Sizwe Pamla says they are giving Ramaphosa today and tomorrow to finalize this issue. "For us, we do not want this weekend to end with President Jacob Zuma still at the helm." The SACP’s Solly Mapaila also they want Ramaphosa to act now. "We would have loved him to be gone already. For us, even the end of the weekend is too far. We hope that in the next two days or so they should be able to make an announcement." Meanwhile now that Ramaphosa won’t be participating in today’s hectic activities for the party, speculation is that he will use the time to conclude talks with President Zuma.
