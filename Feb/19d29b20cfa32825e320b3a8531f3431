SA Rugby announced on Friday it had reached an agreement with Allister Coetzee for him to step down. CAPE TOWN - SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux says the decision to part ways with Springbok coach Allister Coetzee was in the best interests of the national team. The body announced on Friday it had reached an agreement with Coetzee for him to step down. Under Coetzee’s watch, the Springboks managed only 11 wins in his 25 Tests with a win percentage of 44% over his two years as coach. Roux said: “We had to look after the best interest of the Springbok rugby.” The news follows revelations from a leaked document, where Coetzee accused SA Rugby of setting him up to fail, which was indicative of the strained relationship between the coach and the organisation. Under Coetzee, the Boks suffered a first-ever loss to Italy, and record defeats to Italy and New Zealand. Despite the soured relationship, Roux has thanked Coetzee for his work. “We’d like to thank Coetzee for his passion and dedication towards the Boks and the brand. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours.” SA Rugby will manage the responsibilities of the Springbok coach until the new coaching staff is confirmed later in February.   Meanwhile, former Springbok captain Gary Teichmann says the national team’s recent track-record justifies SA Rugby’s decision to part ways with Coetzee. Teichmann led the side in 36 Test matches which included a record 17-match winning streak. He’s reiterated the importance of good results. “We have to strive to be the best in the world. It’s driven by results, fortunately, the Springboks had the right results for the last couple of years.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
