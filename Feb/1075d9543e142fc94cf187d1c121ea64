The Democratic Alliance (DA) earlier this month tabled their own motion against De Lille, after the African National Congress (ANC) in the City Caucus withdrew theirs. CAPE TOWN – City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille will on Wednesday know if a no confidence vote in her will take place in the form of a secret ballot. The Democratic Alliance (DA) earlier this month tabled their own motion against De Lille, after the African National Congress (ANC) in the city caucus withdrew theirs. De Lille lodged an urgent application as she fears that DA caucus members might feel obligated to vote against her in Thursday’s motion. Mayor De Lille is at loggerheads with DA bosses over misconduct and corruption allegations levelled against her. She claims that the party is set on ruining her image. “Last year, both the Speaker of the Council and Chief Whip of Council were just perceived to be too close to the mayor and the next thing they were served with notices why you should not resign of why a vote of no confidence…there is fear and intimidation within our own caucus…” Her defence argues that tomorrow’s vote should represent the true feelings of councillors and the only way to ensure that is to have councillors to vote in secret. The DA says that it is not seeking De Lille’s removal on the grounds of a personal vendetta against her, but is seeking her removal on the grounds of misconduct.
