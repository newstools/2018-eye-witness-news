The former Banyana Banyana striker has started her coaching journey by taking over the reins at eZasedladleni FC in this season's SAB League. JOHANNESBURG - Former Banyana Banyana striker Portia Modise is looking to translate her success on the field to a successful career behind the scenes as a head coach. Modise, the first African player to score 100 goals, has started her coaching journey by taking over the reins at eZasedladleni FC in this season's SAB League. The Mamelodi-based side has responded well to Modise’s leadership and have moved up three places to fifth spot in the league, just three weeks after the 34-year-old took over. “I want to coach in the Premier Soccer League one day and break that chain of not seeing any female coaches leading teams in the PSL. I want to compete with big guys and make them realise that I can be great at coaching too.” Modise is also working through a SAFA-D License coaching course at the Tuks High-Performance Centre in Pretoria and says she wants to motivate her players to continue to do well in their careers. “By doing that, I would also be proving that it doesn’t matter where you come from, the truth is dreams are valid and if you truly believe in yourself, nothing will ever stand in your way.” Modise said that one of her goals is to give back all the knowledge she has gained from all the coaches she has worked with throughout her playing career.
