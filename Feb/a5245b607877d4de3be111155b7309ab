Leaders in the ANC Youth League and MKMVA say they have no choice now but to accept the NEC's decision to recall Jacob Zuma, as well as his decision to go. JOHANNESBURG – Staunch supporters of the former president say they were still hoping the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee (NEC) would allow him to finish his term. Leaders in the ANC Youth League and MKMVA say they have no choice now but to accept the NEC's decision to recall Jacob Zuma, as well as his decision to go. The supporters say they don't necessarily agree with the NEC's decision to get rid of Zuma but will abide by the majority rule principle. Collin Maine, Kebby Maphatsoe, Bathabile Dlamini and many others remained loyal to Zuma, even defending him during scandals including the Nkandla debacle, state capture allegations and his controversial Cabinet reshuffles which resulted in economic downgrades and dealt a huge blow to the rand. Maine says he would have liked to see Zuma finish his term but also welcomes and respects any decision taken by the party's NEC. “At this point it is not about what we say, it’s about what the ANC says.” Maphatsoe says he is one of those who were against recalling Zuma. “It’s a view of the majority that the president must be recalled. We who were against that, must be seen to be the ones who understand better. We’d have liked to see him finish his term.” Eyewitness News tried to contact Dlamini through her office but was informed that she is out of the country, with officials refusing to divulge the details of her exact whereabouts. However, the Women's League has released a statement saying it applauds Zuma for "committing to selflessly serve the movement".
