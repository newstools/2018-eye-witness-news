The 23-year-old will stay in England until the start of the One Day Cup in mid-May. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas opening batsmen Aiden Markram has signed a short-term contract with English County side Durham. Markram who stood in as captain for the injured Faf du Plessis during the One Day International Series against India this month will make it in time for Durham’s opening County game against Kent on 20 April, after the conclusion of the imminent series against Australia. The 23-year-old will stay in England until the start of the One Day Cup in mid-May. Durham Chairman, Sir Ian Botham said that the acquisition of Markram on a short-term deal is great for the Club. “Aiden offers confidence and maturity at the top of the batting order and despite being just 23-years-old, he has already been recognized by South Africa as a leader in the dressing room.”
