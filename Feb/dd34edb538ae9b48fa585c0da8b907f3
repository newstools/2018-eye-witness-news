The Proteas are preparing for a four Test match series against Australia which gets underway in Durban on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas Captain Faf du Plessis says that they haven’t asked for any specific conditions from the groundsmen ahead of their four-Test match series against Australia which gets underway in Durban on Thursday. The India series, which South Africa won by a 2-1 margin, was largely dominated by the nature of the surfaces the two teams played on. Newlands in Cape Town produced a spicy pitch which seemed to assist the fast bowlers, but the SuperSport Park surface was under scrutiny in particular for it’s “sub-continent” like nature. South Africa won both those games before losing the third Test match under controversial circumstances on the Wanderers pitch. Play was suspended late on the fourth day when Dean Elgar was struck on the helmet by a Jasprit Bumrah rising delivery. This time around, du Plessis says that they haven’t consulted the curators at Kingsmead, St Georges Park, Newlands and the Wanderers about the pitch preparations. “I think I learnt my lesson in this regard, and I think that South Africa and Australia are similar teams who play under similar conditions. When you play against a sub-continent side you try and get an advantage somehow, but these two sides are similar, so we will play on what we get, and I certainly haven’t asked for anything specific.” Both sides possess dangerous bowling attacks in their arsenals, which will test the batsmen from both sides in terms of temperament and technique. Though these sides have searing pace in their ranks, the pitch at Kingsmead is expected to take some turn and the likes of Nathan Lyon and Keshav Maharaj are expected to feature heavily should this prediction come into fruition. The first ball from Kingsmead is set to be delivered at 10:00am.
