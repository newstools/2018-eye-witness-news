The companies have also been accused of price fixing. The commission's Sipho Ngwema says: “Parties are given 20 days to respond to the allegation and depending on how they answer, the process will then unfold. “Depending on the role of the Competition Tribunal, we may hear them earlier or later depending as I said on the companies.”
