Maties got off to a shaky start in their clash with FNB CUT, finding themselves 12-0 down in the opening 12 minutes of the game. JOHANNESBURG – FNB Maties went into round four of the Varsity Cup looking to continue their unbeaten start to the season and claim their fourth win from four games, while their nearest rivals FNB Wits were hoping to keep the pressure on the log leaders. Maties got off to a shaky start in their clash with FNB CUT, finding themselves 12-0 down in the opening 12 minutes of the game. The men from Stellenbosch managed to put a disastrous and wasteful opening half hour behind them to run in four tries before the break. Last season’s runners up ran in a further five tries in the second half to claim a commanding 75-12 victory, with eighth-man Marno Redelinghuys scoring a hat-trick on his way to a second successive man of the match performance. The nearest challengers to the current table toppers, FNB Wits, kept within touching distance of top spot as they claimed a narrow 32-29 win away to FNB Madibaz. The clash was tightly contested throughout with the hosts going into the half time break 20-18 ahead. Wits did however manage to take the lead just before the 60th minute strategy break through a Cecil Conradie try. The sides then exchanged seven point tries to set up a nail biting finish, with the men from Braamfontein managing to hold on for a third win a row. In the other games from round four, FNB UJ and FNB Ikeys were on the receiving end of narrow losses going down 18-15 and 32-27 to FNB NWU and FNB Shimlas respectively. Maties top the table on 19 points, with Wits four points behind in second, while Shimlas round out the top three with 14 points.
