Speaking during his visit with other top six members to the king in Nzhelele outside Thohoyandou, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa says the party will put the agenda of renewal forward. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa says the top six leadership is committed to listening to the Vhavhenda King Mphephu Ramabulana’s advise to unite the party and advance the interest of the people. Speaking during his visit with other top six members to the king in Nzhelele outside Thohoyandou, Ramaphosa says the party will put the agenda of renewal forward. He says he’s confident that the ANC will win next year's elections with overwhelming support because the new leadership is returning the ANC to its original state. “Comrade Stan Mathabhata and the TG, they were all here supporting the top six in visiting our traditional leaders and when we come back we are going to meet out people to hear what their issues are as the ANC goes on to solve their problems.” Ramaphosa says traditional leaders are one of the key players who made the ANC what it is today because they have contributed to the formation of the party in 1958. Addressing the Tsonga and Shangaan chiefs in his second leg of traditional leaders’ visit in Limpopo, Ramaphosa says the party is committed to renewing its relationship with traditional leaders. He says the newly elected leadership will take the country forward in the next five years. “This leadership is who we are presenting to the whole country and saying, “we want you to support this leadership”. In the ANC, we are the reservoir of the best policy positions that any organisation has ever had in the history of South Africa.”
