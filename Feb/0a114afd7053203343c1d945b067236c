JOHANNESBURG - Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has been fined 15% of his match fee and slapped with a one demerit point sanction following his send off gesture after picking up the wicket of Indian opener Shikar Dhawan in the fifth ODI in Port Elizabeth. Rabada made the gesture when he had Dhawan caught at deep square leg by Andile Phehlukwayo for 34. The South African fast bowler now has five demerit points on his disciplinary record after receiving three demerit points against Sri Lanka in a one-day international on 8 February 2017 and one demerit point during the Lord’s Test against England on 7 July 2017. Rabada was subsequently suspended from the Trent Bridge Test against England after his accumulated demerit points reached four following the Lord’s breach. If Rabada reaches the next threshold of eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, he will be suspended again from either two Tests; one Test and two ODIs / T20Is; or four ODIs / T20Is, whichever comes first for the player. The Proteas lost the fifth ODI against India by 73 runs and have lost a home series to India for the first time. The six and final ODI will be played at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Friday.
