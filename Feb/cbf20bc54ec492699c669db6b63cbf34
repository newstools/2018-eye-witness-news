It's understood the 22-year-old woman was visiting the private game reserve earlier on Tuesday when the animal attacked her. Paramedics say they arrived on the scene and found bystanders trying to administer CPR. Netcare911's Nick Dollman said: “Tragically the young victim had sustained severe injuries, there was nothing further that paramedics could do to save her and she died at the scene. The SAPS from Cullinan were on the scene and are investigating the incident. The Gauteng Agriculture Department is investigating the circumstances around the attack.
