Semenya says she is hoping to beat the national record of 2:37.20 set in 1983 if all goes well. JOHANNESBURG - Caster Semenya is preparing to run the seldom-run 1,000m race in March at the Athletix Grand Prix meet in Pretoria The 1,000m race is not a championship event, like the 150m race, which will also take place. Semenya says she is hoping to beat the national record if all goes well. “I’ll try to shut down the national record. It favours me and I’m looking forward to this event.” The world champion also said: “A thousand (meters) is one of the races I dreamed doing over the years.” The current national record is held by Ilse de Kick Wicksell with a time of 2:37.20 set in 1983. Semenya says it is still early in the season with the African Championship, European season and the intercontinental championships all still coming up. “It’s going to be a long year. It’s easy, but you need to be smart when making decisions.” Semenya will race at the SA Championships in Pretoria from 15 -17 March and the 1,500m at the final Athletix GP meet in Paarl on 22 March.
