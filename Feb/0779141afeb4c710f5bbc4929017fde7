President Cyril Ramaphosa says the current state of the SANDF is what its first democratic commander-in-chief Nelson Mandela would have been proud of. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says the government is committed to supporting South African National Defence Force (SANDF) initiatives which could lead to the employment of young South Africans. Speaking at an Inter-Faith Prayer Service organised by the Defence Force, Ramaphosa says it’s important that the SANDF continues its support in the development of other African countries through peacekeeping missions. The prayer is being held in Kimberley as part of the build-up ahead of the official commemoration of Armed Forces Day on Wednesday. Ramaphosa says the current state of the SANDF is what its first democratic commander-in-chief Nelson Mandela would have been proud of. “As you participate in these missions, where you’re distinguishing yourselves as the soldiers of our country and dedicated and outstanding members of the SANDF.” He says he rests assured that the defence would never involve itself in politics. “When I met on a one-to-one basis with General Solly Shoke, he assured me that this SANDF will never get involved in politics.” Ramaphosa says despite the change in the country’s leadership, South Africans should remain confident in their Defence Force. “Took courage and comfort in knowing that I can proudly say to the people of South Africa, that this is the SANDF that’s there to protect the republic and people of South Africa.”  WATCH: SANDF Inter-faith Prayer Service
