Chief among their demands is that President Jacob Zuma remains in office until his term ends. JOHANNESBURG - The Black First Land First (BLF) has handed over its memorandum of demands to African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule at Luthuli house on Monday. Chief among their demands is that President Jacob Zuma remains in office until his term ends. The BLF’s Thandiswa Yaphi read the memorandum to Magashule and made the movement’s demands clear. “For the ANC leadership to reject any call for ANC President Jacob Zuma [to step down] and close the chapter.” Magashule welcomed the memorandum. “I’m happy that you are so disciplined and we will talk about the things that you have [raised]. Actually, the NWC is meeting is underway now.” The BLF has since left, with the “Defend Luthuli House” supporters continuing to sing in front of the ANC’s headquarters with a heavy police presence. Earlier, several BLF supporters were assaulted by a group who say they are protecting the ANC's headquarters. The police are maintaining a strong presence. BLF members had gathered at Beyers Naude Square just opposite Luthuli House. The movement’s Abi Letsoalo says they have the right to ask the ANC to keep President Zuma in office. “Thabo Mbeki did not come with a branch; he was nominated to be there. Therefore, this president is there by the people, for the people. Two different scenarios."
