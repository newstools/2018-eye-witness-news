The day’s other televised game sees FNB UJ take on FNB NWU in the final game of the day. JOHANNESBURG - Round four of Varsity Cup gets underway on Monday with the two televised games featuring FNB Wits against FNB Madibaz in the early kickoff. Wits are currently second on the log having won two of their opening three games, including a 25-3 victory over the defending champion Tuks in the second row. The surprise package in the competition so far will be looking to bounce back though, having lost their last game 44-24 to FNB Shimlas after leading the men from the Free State at halftime. The day’s other televised game sees FNB UJ take on FNB NWU in the final game of the day. The men from Johannesburg will be looking to climb above their opponents on the log and build on their 48-21 thumping of CUT in round two. UJ coach Werner Janse van Rensburg says the team from the North West will pose an all-round challenge. “NWU have a good pack with good pace at the back and some experience in key positions. They are always good at home and only our best will be good enough on the evening to get a result.” Pukke, meanwhile, are coming off a hard-fought game against UCT in which they lost out to Ikeys by just two points in Cape Town. The men from the Mother City take on Shimlas and will be looking for their third win on the bounce. The Tigers will once again look to their forwards to batter the opposition defensive line and hope that their speedy backline can once again make an impact. Shimlas can force their way into the top four with a victory, with both teams currently on nine points. The round wouldn’t be complete without the current log leaders as Maties look to continue their unbeaten start to the season when they take on CUT at the Danie Craven Stadium.
