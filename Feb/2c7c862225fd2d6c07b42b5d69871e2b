The FPB says the movie is not suitable for those under 18 as the initiation practices it portrays should not be viewed by minors. JOHANNESBURG - The Film and Publications Board's appeal tribunal's decision to reclassify the South African film Inxeba to a rating of x18, has prompted the Democratic Alliance (DA) to weigh in on the matter. The tribunal has released a report detailing the reasons why it has increased the film's rating. It says the movie is not suitable for those under 18 as the initiation practices it portrays should not be viewed by minors. The DA's Phumzile van Damme says they will challenge this decision. “The DA is exploring its options to fight against a serious violation of freedom of expression.”
