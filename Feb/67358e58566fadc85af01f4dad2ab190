It’s a bigger story than the election of Cyril Ramaphosa at the African National Congress’ elective conference in December 2017. JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma’s recall has launched South Africa back into the world headlines. Television, radio and print media in the world capitals are watching developments closely. It’s record business for foreign correspondents and stringers based in South Africa or parachuted into the country. The denouement of the Zuma drama is attracting attention akin to the death of Nelson Mandela. It’s a bigger story than the election of Cyril Ramaphosa at the ANC elective conference last December. In addition to the newshounds, the story’s attracting close attention from finance reporters. Hot on their heels are the ratings agencies. A speedy solution might persuade them that South Africa deserves to start climbing out of the junk status into which it’s sunk during the Zuma Presidency.  CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENTS WITH ZUMA The ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that it had recalled President Zuma. The NEC has briefed the media on the outcome of Monday's special NEC meeting which ended in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The meeting was called to discuss and finalise Zuma's future as head of state. The president has been under pressure to leave office following Ramaphosa's election as ANC president. The ANC says its leaders had fruitful and constructive engagements with Zuma. Asked what was fruitful or constructive about the discussions if they failed to agree on his removal, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule confirmed that President Zuma wanted to serve for three more months before resigning, but the secretary-general says the ANC was concerned about the anxiety around the issue.
