The man was found in possession of one of the firearms stolen from the Ngcobo Police Station where five officers were killed last week. NGCOBO, Eastern Cape - A sixth suspect in the Ngcobo police massacre has been arrested. The man was taken into custody on Tuesday night. He was apparently found in possession of a firearm of one of the police officers gunned down in the attack on the Eastern Cape town’s police station. A special police task force swooped on the Seven Angels Ministries church last Friday and initially arrested ten suspects. But several of them had to be released due to a lack of evidence. Seven more suspects were killed in a gun battle during last Friday’s raid. Five accused have already appeared in court this week. The sixth suspect, arrested last night, will be in the dock on Thursday.
