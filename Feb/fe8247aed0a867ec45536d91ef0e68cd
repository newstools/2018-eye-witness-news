President Jacob Zuma was due to attend and officiate at the annual the event which was scheduled for Saturday in Cape Town. JOHANNESBURG - The International Relations Department has announced the Ubuntu Awards have been postponed. President Jacob Zuma was due to attend and officiate at the annual the event which was scheduled for Saturday in Cape Town. The department’s Clayson Monyela says due to the State of the Nation Address (Sona) being postponed, events traditionally hosted after the Sona have been affected. “The 2018 Ubuntu Awards is one of the events affected. We've taken the position to postpone the awards until further notice.” Meanwhile, a group calling themselves 'Concerned ANC and SACP members' is planning to march on the Union Buildings on Monday to demand that Zuma leave office immediately. Spokesperson for the group Hangwi Maumela says they’re concerned about these lengthy discussions between Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa. “These transition talks are jeopardising the integrity of the ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa.” He says the ANC and the country can’t afford another day of Zuma in office. “We’re not satisfied that he’s still the president of the country.” The SACP has confirmed that some of its leaders may attend an anti-Zuma march on Monday. Parties are discussing plans for a countrywide shutdown that will send a strong message to the ANC over the length of time it’s taking to get the president to step down. They're also calling for an urgent sitting in the National Assembly on Tuesday to debate and vote on a motion of no confidence in Zuma.
