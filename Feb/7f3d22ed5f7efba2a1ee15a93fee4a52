JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs’ young striker Ryan Moon has enjoyed a successful and prolonged run in Steve Khompela’s first team and has rewarded the faith shown in him by contributing in the goals department. The 21-year-old Moon has scored in Chiefs’ last four games, including the 3-0 drubbing of Golden Arrows in the round of 32 of the Nedbank Cup in their last match. Moon joined the Glamour Boys from Maritzburg United a little over a year ago and has slowly worked his way into first team recognition. The younger brother of former Bafana Bafana defender Bryce Moon, Ryan says that he is happy with his form in front of goal recently, but he can’t let it get to his head. “I’m honoured to be called Chiefs’ ‘Messiah’ but I can’t let that get to my head, I have a big enough head already so it’s important for me to keep my feet on the ground and continue working hard.” The men from Naturena take on top of the table rivals Cape Town City on Saturday, a clash that can determine either side's league title race this season. Moon believes that Bennie McCarthy’s Cape Town City pose a big threat to their title ambitions. “They are a good team and they won’t be coming to the FNB Stadium for just one point, they are going to come here for all three points, so it’s going to be a tough game that will determine both sides' title momentum now in the final stretch.” Chiefs and City are sitting fourth and fifth on the log, with both sides sitting on 31 points each. Kick-off at the FNB Stadium is a 20:15 on Saturday night.
