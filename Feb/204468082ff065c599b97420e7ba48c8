The EFF has postponed its urgent court application for a motion of no confidence to be brought forward following engagements with the ruling party caucus in Parliament. CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says they are in talks with African National Congress (ANC) leaders and have postponed their urgent court application to have their motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma brought forward. A motion of no confidence would be the quickest way of unseating President Zuma, should he defy his party’s decision to recall him. But the ANC has been reluctant to back an opposition motion. ANC MPs started their special caucus meeting almost an hour ago, where they were to be briefed on the national executive committee (NEC)’s decision to recall Zuma and to discuss a backup strategy should he not heed it. WATCH: ANC NEC recalls President Zuma  The EFF has so far been adamant that it will not withdraw its motion of no confidence, set down for next Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, it gave Speaker Baleka Mbete an ultimatum to schedule it for this week or face legal action. Now the party says it has shelved its urgent court application, pending the outcome of talks with the ANC. The EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says: “We are talking to the leadership of the ANC. As soon as those engagements are concluded we shall advise the public as to what is going to be the way forward.” While it seems unlikely that the EFF will withdraw its motion to allow the ANC to table its own, it is also possible some agreement might be hammered out that would allow all parties to throw their weight behind a no confidence vote in President Jacob Zuma and make sure that it succeeds.
