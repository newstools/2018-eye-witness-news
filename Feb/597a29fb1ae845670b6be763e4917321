At Parliament on Tuesday, EFF leader Julius Malema threatened the Democratic Alliance (DA) with divorce where the two organisations are in municipal coalitions. CAPE TOWN - Port Elizabeth Mayor Athol Trollip is worried. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) intend on tabling a motion of no confidence against him. EFF leader Julius Malema: "On the 6th of April, the day of Jan van Riebeeckâ€™s arrival, the day of the formation of the PAC by Robert Sobukwe and the hanging of Solomon Mahlangu - in honour of these people but also a demonstration of seriousness about land we will be passing a motion of no confidence on the mayor of PE as a warning shot." At Parliament on Tuesday, party leader Malema threatened the Democratic Alliance (DA) with divorce where the two organisations are in municipal coalitions. Malema wants to punish the DA for not backing the party's motion on land expropriation without compensation, which was passed in the National Assembly with the help of the African National Congress (ANC). The DA's control in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan is under threat, following Malema's warning after the party failed to support the red berets' motion. Athol Trollip says that he is concerned: "We are concerned. We offered the voters change and change they got. The EFF decided to support us in the last motion of no confidence against me and now apparently they're bringing their own." But he adds it's all just a politicial game. "This is where the ANC is most vulnerable, Nelson Mandela Bay, and they want to return it to the ANC for a trade-off for their own positions in power. So good luck to them." The motion could be tabled in April.
