JOHANNESBURG - The National Lottery says three of five winners from the recent record-breaking jackpot are yet to claim their millions. Last week’s jackpot was set at a whopping R110 million. Lottery manager Ithuba says a 38-year-old KwaZulu-Natal woman has come forward to claim her R27 million share. Spokesperson Sandisiwe Gugushe has urged all players to check if they are holding the winning tickets. “The woman from KZN was a regular player and was unaware that she’d won.”
