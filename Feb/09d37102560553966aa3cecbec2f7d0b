JOHANNESBURG- The 6th of February marks a year sent the passing of Springbok legend Joost van der Westhuizen who passed away after a long battle with motor neuron disease. The legendary scrumhalf represented South Africa 89 times and participated in three World Cup tournaments in which he won the historic 1995 title on home soil. Van der Westhuizen was a nippy scrumhalf, who had a terrific eye for the whitewash, and his 38 Test tries came mostly from snipes around the breakdown area. In 2001, van der Westhuizen was the first Springbok to play in 100 games for the national side and his career also included 71 appearances in Super Rugby for the Bulls. He was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in May 2011 and passed away on 6 February 2017. WATCH: Joost van der Westhuizen's last Loftus visit
