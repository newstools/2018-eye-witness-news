Castle Free, one of SA Breweries’ new products, will be the sponsor of the South African men’s and women’s Sevens sides for the next three and a half years. JOHANNESBURG - SA Rugby and SA Breweries have announced that Castle Free, one of SA Breweries’ new products, will be the sponsor of the South African men’s and women’s Sevens sides for the next three and a half years. The announcement follows SA Rugby and controversial investment company Steinhoff International parting ways last month. SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux says that he is excited about the partnership between the two parties. “The three-and-a-half-year deal to back the Blitzboks and our Sevens programme is, in fact, part of the continued partnership we have had with SA Breweries over many years,” said Roux. “They have been involved in sponsoring other national teams such as the Springboks in the past and are currently the title sponsor to all of the Boks’ competitions and tours, such as the Castle Lager Incoming Series and the Castle Lager Rugby Championship. “We are delighted to have Castle Free as the brand associated with our championship-winning Blitzboks. “Castle Free was first launched at the HSBC Cape Town Sevens tournament last year, so the power and potential of a partnership with the Blitzboks and SA Rugby was a natural next step. The Springbok Sevens team is on a journey of inspiring the nation and SA Breweries have always done the same.”
