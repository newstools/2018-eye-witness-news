Jobodwana is the first man to break 20 seconds in the 200m in South Africa when he ran 19.87sec on his way to a World Championship bronze medal in 2015. JOHANNESBURG - South African sprinter Anaso Jobodwana will compete in the first leg of the inaugural Athletics Grand Prix at the Ruimsig Stadium in March. Jobodwana is the first man to break 20 seconds in the 200m in South Africa when he ran 19.87sec on his way to a World Championship bronze medal in 2015, in what was then an SA record. The 200m has always been Jobodwana’s favourite race, even though he has had success in the 100m when he won the World University Games title in both events (100m and 200m) in 2013. The announcement of Jobodwana’s participation comes at the back of another top athlete’s commitment to the Grand Prix, Ugandan long-distance runner Joshua Cheptegei on Tuesday. The Athletics Grand Prix will start at the Ruimsig Stadium on 1 March, before moving to Tuks Stadium on 8 March and finishing off at the Dal Josaphat Stadium in Paarl on 22 March.
