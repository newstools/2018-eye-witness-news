CAPE TOWN - The pesky "stink bug" is preventing thousands of Japanese cars from being delivered to New Zealand. According to CNN, three cargo ships carrying imported cars and machinery were refused entry at New Zealand ports this month after they were found to have hordes of the bugs aboard. Stink bugs are a major threat in New Zealand. The critters could wreak havoc across the country's farms as they tend to reproduce quickly, eat a broad variety of crops and resist most pesticides. David Vinsen, CEO of New Zealand's Imported Motor Vehicle Industry Association, told CNN: “"In my 15 years in this role, and probably 30 years involved in this industry, I have not seen anything which is as serious as this.”
