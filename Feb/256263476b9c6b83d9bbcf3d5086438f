Young scrum-half Marco Janse van Vuuren comes onto the bench in place of Marnus Schoeman who drops out of the matchday 23 JOHANNESBURG- The Highveld Lions have made just two changes to the side to face the Argentine outfit the Jaguares in their second game of the 2018 Super Rugby campaign. Lock Andries Ferreira who withdrew from the side that beat the Sharks 26-19 in round one due to a stomach bug, comes in to partner with Springbok Franco Mostert at lock. Young scrum-half Marco Janse van Vuren comes onto the bench in place of Marnus Schoeman who drops out of the matchday 23. The Lions showed a great forward display against the Sharks, particularly in the scrums where they were most dominant. De Bruyn said they wanted to keep as much continuity in selection as possible. “The coaching staff and leadership group and I have spoken a lot about consistency but also giving the younger guys an opportunity. “Last week Andries had to pull out with a little stomach bug before the game but he is 100% and ready to start this week. Young Marco has trained really well this week and I know Ross Cronje is a tough man, but I felt that this week I needed to give him some cover on the bench.” The Jaguares went down 28-20 to the Stormers last week in a match they came back very well in. after being down 22-6 after 50 minutes, the Argentines clawed their way back as the Stormers took their foot off the peddle. De Bruyn says that they won’t take the Jaguares lightly. “They are virtually an international side and they pose a lot of different kinds of threats to us, so we will need to be on top of our game.” The match between the Lions and Jaguares kicks off at 3:05 pm on Saturday.
