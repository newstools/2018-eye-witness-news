The R100,000 cheque was handed over to the Gift of the Givers at the last T20 International at PPC Newlands on Sunday. JOHANNESBURG- The South African and Indian cricket teams donated R100,000 towards the water relieve crisis in Cape Town after the completion of their tour Itinerary with a T20 at Newlands Stadium. The cheque was handed over to the Gift of the Givers at the last T20 International at PPC Newlands on Sunday. Gift of the Givers will use the donation to drill boreholes as well as supply bottled water to organisations in desperate need. “Both teams had first-hand experience of the water crisis in Cape Town and, having chatted to Virat [Kohli], we decided to get our teams to sign some jerseys which we auctioned off with the funds raised going to assist the Cape Town water crisis,” explained Faf Du Plessis. “We also wanted to create awareness and hope that other organisations and sports codes follow in our direction.” Kohli stressed the importance of getting involved in this campaign. “Cape Town is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and whenever we visit and play at Newlands, we are treated extremely well by the local people. We are playing our part in highlighting the drought, so people can see the seriousness of what’s taking place in the Mother City.”
