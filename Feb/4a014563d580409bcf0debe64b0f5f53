JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs boss Steve Komphela says that his team won’t come with a defensive mindset and will not be “parking the bus” when they come up against rivals Orlando Pirates in the much-anticipated Soweto Derby on Saturday. The two teams are separated by just a single point at the top of the Premiership table and three points for either side will keep them in the hunt for league honours and narrow the gap between themselves and leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Pirates are arguably the form side going into the match, having dispatched Chippa United 4-2 on the weekend while Chiefs are coming off a goalless draw against Bloemfontein Celtic. Chiefs, however, do boast a solid defensive record in the league this season. The Glamour Boys have only conceded 12 goals, which is the least number of goals conceded in the league, and eight less than their derby opponents who have leaked 20 so far. Komphela believes that their defensive record shouldn’t fool people because they will not be looking to settle for a point on Saturday. "We have 3 defenders and 7 attackers. Chiefs have never park the bus, come 6 o'clock on Saturday there will be people rejoicing, I hope it will be the Gold and Black” Despite Chiefs still being in contention to win either the Nedbank Cup and the league trophy, Komphela’s future is still uncertain, but the former Maritzburg United coach believes that victory on Saturday will go a long way in establishing themselves as full-on favourite to overhaul Sundowns. “I had a look at Sundowns fixtures and they are due to compete in the Champions league soon and that will definitely increase their workload. I am almost positive that whoever wins between Chiefs and Pirates on Saturday will be strong favourites to catch Sundowns.”
