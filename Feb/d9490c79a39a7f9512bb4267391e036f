JOHANNESBURG- Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rulani Mokwena says his side has done their thorough analysis of Kaizer Chiefs ahead of their crucial Soweto Derby on Saturday. The two Soweto Giants are separated by just a point, with Pirates in second position behind Mamelodi Sundowns. The clash has in recent times come under severe criticism for producing dull draws, but Mokwena believes the derby is still a big event of the South African sporting calendar. “It’s grown to be bigger and better, and it now can only be staged at FNB Stadium because of it’s magnitude and the number of people it attracts.” Pirates will go into the clash as the form side and favourites ahead of Chiefs. The Ghost’s recent record makes pleasant reading and they are fresh off a 4-2 drubbing of Chippa United, while Chiefs are coming off a disappointing draw against Bloemfontein Celtic. Mokwena, who will be participating in his first Soweto Derby having moved from Sundowns at the beginning of the season, believes that The Amakhosi's form still warrants a full analysis of their opponents. “We have done our analysis already and we have looked at their recent matches which is the first approach when you look at opponents and we are in the process of making a full report on Chiefs.” The match is expected to be a sold-out event once again, with kick-off at the FNB Stadium scheduled for 15:30 on Saturday.
