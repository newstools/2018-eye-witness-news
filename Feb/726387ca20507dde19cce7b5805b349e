The European Union’s remaining member states want a 'close and deep' relationship with Britain after its departure from the bloc. BERLIN - The European Union’s remaining member states want a “close and deep” relationship with Britain after its departure from the bloc, but it is for Britain to make proposals as to how it imagines that relationship, a German government spokesman said. “We want, all the EU-27 want a close and deep relationship with this important partner. It is also clear that the relationship will be different from when it was in the EU,” said spokesman Steffen Seibert. “It is important for us for Britain to make concrete its ideas.” At the same time, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was important for the remaining 27 countries to remain united and let the Commission’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier deal with the British government. But he indicated his impatience at a topic that has dominated the EU’s agenda, adding: “I don’t want to waste too much time on the issue.” At a time when European capitals are preparing to promote their own nationals for strategic posts coming open next year at the top of EU institutions, Macron said he would not make a priority of finding jobs for French candidates. He said he did not care about the nationality of the next head of the European Central Bank, as long as he or she was as competent as its current chief, Mario Draghi.
