JOHANNESBURG - Proteas all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo says that his side need to take India’s dangerous top order out early and expose their fragile middle order if they are to have a chance in the fifth ODI in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Phehlukwayo, who played a starring role in the Proteas' five-wicket (D/L) victory in the fourth one-day interantional at the Wanderers, by smashing a quick-fire 23 off 5 deliveries, including a massive six to finish the game. The Proteas are chasing their second victory in the six-match series after falling behind 3-0 in the first three games. The Wanderers' victory may have given stand-in captain Aiden Markram’s men plenty of confidence to overturn the deficit and square the series three-all. The wicket of the Indian captain Virat Kohli will be of particular importance, as his form in the series has mesmerized all. Kohli has scored 393 runs so far in the series, including a masterful 160 in the third ODI in Cape Town. Phehlukwayo says that getting those early top order wickets and exposing their middle order batsmen will be important. “Their top order has been batting really well, and it would be nice to get them early and expose their middle order and see what they can do.” The 21-year-old Phehlukwayo also believes that momentum is on their side after that scintillating victory at the Wanderers. “We have good momentum now after the Wanderers game and we always felt that the win wasn’t too far away because we have really been working hard in the nets.” The fifth ODI from St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth gets underway at 13:00 on Tuesday afternoon.
