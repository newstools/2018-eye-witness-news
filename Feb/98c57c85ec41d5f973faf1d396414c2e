JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs scored three late goals to knock Golden Arrows out in the first round of the Nedbank Cup at the FNB Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Ryan Moon started the rout for Chiefs as his deflected shot found the back of the net after a powerful cross into the box by Ramahlwe Mphahlele in the 52nd minute of the game. Moon turned out to be a menace for the Arrows defense, as his combination play with Mphahlele down the right-hand side caused all sorts of problems. Moon had another deflected shot cannon off the crossbar from another pinpoint Mphahlele cross. Arrows, though, were also beginning to create chances of their own and Knox Mutizwa forced a brave save from Itumeleng Khune from close range to preserve the Glamour Boys' lead. Bernard Parker was introduced for the first time this year following a long ankle injury lay-of and he, put in a neat chip over the defense before rounding the 'keeper and doubling Chiefs’ lead with 20 minutes to go. The two-goal deficit wasn’t deterring Arrows from pushing for a goal, but Khune was in fine form in between the sticks as he pulled off another brilliant save from a powerful Yusuf Jappie shot. Joseph Maloangwane then confirmed Chiefs’ progression into the next round of the Nedbank Cup when his tap in made it 3-0 to the hosts. In other results from the Nedbank Cup from Sunday, the Royal Eagles beat Happy Wanderers 1-0 at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium, Bloemfontein Celtic needed penalties to further compound Eric Tinkler and SuperSport United’s woes, beating them 5-4 on penalties after the game ended 1-all, while EC Bees made light work of Mariveni United 3-1 at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.
