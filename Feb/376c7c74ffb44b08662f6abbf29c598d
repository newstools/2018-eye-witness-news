Donald Trump met with pupils, families and teachers affected by a Florida high school shooting in which 17 people were killed. NEW YORK - US President Donald Trump is being criticised for suggesting teachers at schools should be armed as an answer to school shootings. Trump met with pupils, families and teachers affected by a Florida high school shooting in which 17 people were killed. The president tweeted on Thursday that he never said teachers should have guns. He then repeated his quote from Wednesday night’s meeting about looking into the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience. He added a gun free school is a magnet for “bad people”. He has suggested the survivors of the 14 February shooting urged him to prevent similar attacks from happening. A 19-year-old former student at the school, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with carrying out the shooting. Authorities say he was armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault-style rifle. Trump said on Wednesday he would tighten background checks for gun buyers and consider lifting the age limit to buy some kinds of guns. Tightening gun laws would mark a change in course for Trump, who has championed gun rights. The NRA opposes an outright ban on bump stocks but has said it would be open to restrictions on the devices. Later this week, Trump will meet with local and state officials, and also plans to talk with governors about the issue. Additional reporting by Reuters. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
