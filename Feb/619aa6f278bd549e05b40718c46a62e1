The two leaders also agreed that a US-Britain data sharing agreement would benefit both countries and that they would advocate for legislation together, according to the White House. WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, in a telephone conversation on Tuesday, agreed that “all responsible nations must increase pressure on North Korea until it turns to the path of denuclearisation,” the White House said. It said the two leaders also agreed that a US-Britain data sharing agreement would benefit both countries and that they would advocate for legislation together. Meanwhile, Trump drew a fierce reaction from angry Britons, including health minister Jeremy Hunt, on Monday after criticising Britain’s publicly funded healthcare system as “going broke and not working”. Trump used Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) to make a domestic political point arguing against the provision of universal healthcare, but in doing so was perceived to have bad-mouthed a system held dear by his country’s closest ally. “The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!” Trump tweeted. Britain’s health system delivers free care for all. It is typically one of the most important issues for voters during elections and often regarded as a weakness for May’s Conservative, or Tory, Party, whose opponents accuse the government of inadequately investing in it. Outraged Britons flocked to Twitter with message defending the NHS, with many pointing out that the march Trump referred to was organized by groups that want to increase the health service’s funding, not dismantle it.
