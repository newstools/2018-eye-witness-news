The 6-0 Pink Day record will be under pressure from an Indian side that has been ruthless with both bat and ball in the three matches so far. JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas go into the fourth One Day International match against India at the Wanderers in a desperate state for victory, having lost the first three ODI’s. The wrist spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav has been the Proteas' undoing in the six-match series so far. The two spinners have ripped the inexperienced South African batting line-up apart, that hasn’t included the likes of Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers, who have been missing due to hand injuries. The Proteas are yet to taste defeat when they have donned the pink outfit, which is an initiative to raise breast cancer awareness. In the six previous occasions that the Proteas have turned out in the pink clothing, they have won every single one, and have provided great entertainment for the crowds. One man that has been the source of entertainment in previous years has been de Villiers, whose return for the must-win fourth ODI is a timely one. Stand-in captain Aiden Markram’s men will need de Villiers to fire on all cylinders if they are to win their first game of the season and keep the series alive. The 6-0 Pink Day record will be under pressure from an Indian side that has been ruthless with both bat and ball in the three matches so far. Captain Virat Kohli has led on the batting front and has been light years apart from his South African counterparts. Kohli has pilled on the runs, while his wrist spinners have dismantled the Proteas on all three occasions. Proteas all-rounder Chris Morris says that there is a bit of pressure going into the Pink Day ODI. “Yeah, there’s always natural pressure and the unbeaten run in the Pink Day has added a little bit more pressure, and it is do or die for us now because one more loss and the series is over.” The fourth ODI at the Wanderers gets underway at 10:00 am on Saturday morning.
