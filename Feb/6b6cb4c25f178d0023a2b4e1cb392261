An Iranian drone fired from Syria was successfully intercepted by the Israeli army on Saturday morning. TEL AVIV - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is holding a series of urgent consultations following a flare-up on the Israeli-Syrian border on Saturday morning. Israel is seeking Russia's urgent intervention to prevent further escalation. Russia is in control of the skies over Syria and has good relations with Israel, Syria and Iran. Northern Israel is in a state of high alert after an Iranian drone fired from Syria was successfully intercepted by the Israeli army on Saturday morning. Immediately afterwards, eight Israeli fighter jets attacked the site from where the drone was launched, prompting the Syrian army to retaliate with widespread antiaircraft fire. It hit one of the Israeli planes, seriously injuring one of two pilots who ejected before the plane crashed into northern Israel. The Syrian army has declared that Israel “carried out a new aggression” and that claims it hit more than one Israeli plane. The Israeli army denies this and says it's ready for various scenarios and will continue to act according to situation assessments. Iran, meanwhile, has refused to comment but warned it could wreak havoc to America bases in the region and create havoc for Israel.
