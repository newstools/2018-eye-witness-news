With the country on tenterhooks over President Zuma’s political future, the national leadership is also trying to put on a united front to rebuild the organisation. JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC)’s top leaders are fanning out across Cape Town on Friday morning in what could be considered a charm offensive of sorts. It’s part of the governing party’s Nelson Mandela centenary celebrations, which starts with an address by ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa on the Grand Parade this weekend. But with the country on tenterhooks over President Jacob Zuma’s political future, the national leadership is also trying to put on a united front to rebuild the organisation and allay possible concerns over the head of state’s exit.  Meanwhile, ANC deputy president and Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza will be zoning in on the local transport industry in Khayelitsha on Friday. Mabuza is also in Cape Town for the ANC’s Nelson Mandela centenary celebrations. He joins his fellow ANC leaders as they criss-cross the Mother City on Friday. Mabuza will be spending time in Khayelitsha in a walkabout at a train station and a taxi rank. He’s also planning to meet with small business owners in the area. Some locals may want to quiz the ANC deputy president on the discussions between Ramaphosa and President Zuma. It’s top-of-mind for many South Africans. Mabuza has in recent weeks emphatically stated his support for Ramaphosa.  WATCH: #Zexit: Word on the street  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
