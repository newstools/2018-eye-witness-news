Desiree Ellis had been serving on an interim basis for the past 18 months since Vera Pauw left the position in 2016. JOHANNESBURG- The South African Football Association on Thursday confirmed the permanent appointment of former Banyana Banyana captain as the head coach of the women’s national team. Desiree Ellis had been serving on an interim basis for the past 18 months since Vera Pauw left the position in 2016. Under Ellis, Banyana Banyana won the 2017 Women’s COSAFA Cup, while they were also voted the best Women’s side by CAF in the same year. SAFA President Danny Jordaan confirmed Ellis’ appointment at the SAFA headquarters on Thursday and presented her with a South African jersey bearing the number that she used to wear during her playing days. Jordaan gave Ellis a few mandates as head coach, including qualifying for the Women’s African Cup of Nations in Ghana, World Cup qualification and the Olympics. “We would like to congratulate Desiree on her appointment as the full-time head coach of the South African Women’s football team. She has done a great job so far and she still has a tough assignment ahead,” Said Jordaan. Ellis said that she is delighted to be appointed on a permanent basis. “I would like to thank SAFA for this opportunity. To me it never felt like I was an interim coach, I also felt like I was the coach of the team.” Banyana Banyana depart for the Cyprus Cup on Friday afternoon where they will take on Slovakia, Hungary and Korea.
