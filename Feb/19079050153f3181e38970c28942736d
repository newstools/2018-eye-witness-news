Representatives from various organisations have called on the ANC to keep President Jacob Zuma in power until the end of his term in 2019. JOHANNESBURG - Twelve organisations working under the slogan “Hands Off President Zuma” have announced they will be marching to Luthuli House in Johannesburg on Monday. Their memorandum will include calls for President Jacob Zuma to remain head of state, land expropriation to begin and that radical economic transformation policies be implemented. The organisations include the Unemployed Peoples Trust, Black First Land First, black caucus and former mine workers.  Representatives from various organisations have called on the ANC to keep President Zuma in power until the end of his term in 2019. Black First Land First’s Thandiswa Yaphi says the ANC needs to redirect its attention from removing Zuma to implementing radical economic transformation. “If they touch ANN7, they touch President Zuma.”  Sizwe Zuma from Umbimbi Lwamabutho says agricultural land needs to be returned to the indigenous people of South Africa. “We want our land… we want recognition of our culture.” Representatives say the march will take place on Monday where a memorandum will be given to the ANC secretary-general.
