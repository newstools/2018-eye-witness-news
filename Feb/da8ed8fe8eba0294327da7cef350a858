JOHANNESBURG – The Sunshine Tour has committed itself to use less water at this week’s tournament in an attempt to assist the City of Cape Town in their efforts to save water. The tournament itself has been moved from its usual course, the Royal Cape Golf Club to the King David Mowbray Golf Club, where the course is treated with effluent water. Another measure taken by the Tour is to encourage golfers to use showers only on the Tuesday of the pro-am, on Friday for the players who miss the cut and on Sunday after the final round. Organisers have also brought in 700 cases of bottled water from Gauteng for the players, as well as operational areas. The use of disposable cutlery in catering areas will also be implemented to remove the need for washing dishes. The Tour will also use the tournament as an opportunity to raise awareness around "Day Zero" by encouraging the players to wear blue during Friday’s second round. A social media campaign will also be run, which aims to engage the public, players and tournament staff. The sixth edition of the tournament gets underway on Thursday.
