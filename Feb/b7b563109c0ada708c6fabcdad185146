The Stormers will clash with the Waratahs in the second round, before travelling to New Zealand to take on the Highlanders and the Crusaders. JOHANNESBURG – Stormers coach Robbie Fleck has named his 27-man Super Rugby squad for the upcoming three match tour of Australasia, with Pieter-Steph du Toit returning to the squad after recovering from a knee injury. Although the squad will be boosted by the return of Du Toit, they will be without hooker Bongi Mbonambi for the tour after the hooker suffered a burst appendix. Mbonambi’s withdrawal means that Dean Muir, who made his debut off the bench against the Jaguares, is included in the touring squad. Fleck will also be able to take the likes of Sikhumbuzo Notshe and Caylib Oosthuizen down under, after both players missed out at the weekend. The Stormers boss says that the squad is looking forward to the tour and to building on their opening 28-20 point victory. “We enjoy touring as a group and feel that there were plenty of positives in our performance against the Jaguares that we can build on in the coming weeks.” The Stormers will clash with the Waratahs in the second round, before travelling to New Zealand to take on the Highlanders and the Crusaders. DHL Stormers touring squad: Nizaam Carr, Damian de Allende, Jan de Klerk, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Dewaldt Duvenage, JJ Engelbrecht, JC Janse van Rensburg, Steven Kitshoff, Siya Kolisi (captain), Dillyn Leyds, Wilco Louw, SP Marais, Dean Muir, Sikhumbuzo Notshe, Caylib Oosthuizen, Justin Phillips, Raymond Rhule, Carlu Sadie, Ramone Samuels, JD Schickerling, Seabelo Senatla, Kobus van Dyk, Chris van Zyl, EW Viljoen, George Whitehead, Cobus Wiese, Damian Willemse.
