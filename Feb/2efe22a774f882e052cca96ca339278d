CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille wants Democratic Alliance (DA) councillors to vote with their conscience in a secret ballot when they cast their ballots during a motion of no confidence in her. De Lille says that she has filed an urgent court application to ensure that this happens when the motion, brought by the DA, is heard on 15 February. The DA’s move comes as De Lille is accused of turning a blind eye to corruption, faces a criminal complaint of bribery and is criticized for her handling of the water crisis. In a lengthy statement on Twitter, Patricia de Lille says that she doesn’t want to avoid a motion of no confidence, but instead wants the assurance that it will proceed in a constitutional and fair manner. The mayor says that DA councillors are bound by caucus decisions and are only allowed a free vote on abortion and the death penalty. She adds that the Speaker also does not have the power to order a secret ballot. De Lille is now challenging these regulations, saying that she believes that her supporters want their representatives to be given an opportunity to vote against the motion without fear of being side-lined in the party. She says it’s ironic that this is her last option, when the DA also had to go to court for a secret ballot in a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma.
