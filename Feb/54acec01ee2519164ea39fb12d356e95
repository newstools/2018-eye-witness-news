The club’s inconsistent performance has led to speculation that Wenger’s 22-year reign could come to an end after the current season. BENGALURU - Long-serving Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is hopeful of seeing out his current two-year contract at the Premier League club amid speculation about his future. The Frenchman signed a new contract at Arsenal at the end of last season but the club have shown little progress this as they sit sixth in the league, knocked out of the FA Cup and unsure of Champions League qualification for next season. The club’s inconsistent performance has led to speculation that Wenger’s 22-year reign could come to an end after the current season. ”I have always respected my contracts,“ Wenger, 68, told beIN Sports on Thursday. ”I would like to remind you I said no to all the biggest clubs in the world to respect my contract so that’s always what I try to do. ”After that we have as well to accept in our job that the future is the future but for me that’s to win the next game. “We have to perform better in every single game and show until the end of the season a complete hunger to win every single game. That’s what it’s about for us.” Arsenal’s best chances of winning a trophy remain in the League Cup, as they face Manchester City in the final on 25 February, and the Europa League, where they recorded a 3-0 win over Ostersunds in the first leg of their last 32 tie on Thursday. The Europa League is also Arsenal’s most viable option to qualify for the Champions League next season as the eight-point gap to fourth-placed Chelsea in the league appears insurmountable with 11 games left to play.
