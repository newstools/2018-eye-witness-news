PRETORIA - Bechir Saleh, the man known as Muammar Gaddafi's banker, is in intensive care at a Johannesburg hospital after being shot last Friday.

He left the country after the 2011 killing of Gaddafi and briefly took shelter in France before coming to South Africa. Heâ€™s wanted by Interpol and the French authorities. He was attacked by five men near Melrose Arch while driving home. One shot entered his stomach. The motive for the attack is unknown.
