Aiden Markram's men came into the match under pressure after losing the first three ODIs in Durban, Centurion and Cape Town convincingly. JOHANNESBURG - The Proteas won the toss and elected to field first in the must-win fourth Pink Day ODI against India at the Wanderers. Aiden Markram's men came into the match under pressure after losing the first three ODIs in Durban, Centurion and Cape Town convincingly, and have struggled against the wrist spin duo of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. The Proteas decided to go into the match without a specialist spinner, and an all-seam attack at the Bullring. The Indians got off to a fast start, but Kagiso Rabada again showed his athleticism when he had the struggling Rohit Sharma brilliantly caught and bowled for 5. Virat Kohli then joined Shikar Dhawan and together piled on the pressure on the South African bowlers, hitting them to all parts of the ground. Dhawan was the first to reach the half-century mark, his 26th in his career, reaching the milestone in just 53 deliveries. The pace of the Proteas' bowlers was proving all too comfortable for the Indian duo, as runs began to flow easily. Kohli brought up yet another half ton in this series, in only 56 balls and India were cruising at 127/1. The pair then took their partnership passed the 150 mark and looked ominous, but Chris Morris removed the dangerous Kohli for 75. The wicket of Kohli didn't deter Dhawan who brought up his 13th ODI century at better than a run a ball. The rain stopped play prematurely at the Wanderers, but India are in a commanding position at 200/2.
