DA leader Mmusi Maimane has written to the National Assembly requesting that the address be postponed until after the country has a new president. JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has questioned the point of this year's State of the Nation Address (Sona), saying that taxpayers should not be funding the event if President Jacob Zuma will be giving the speech. Maimane has written to the National Assembly requesting that the address be postponed until after the country has a new president. The State of the Nation Address is scheduled to be held next week. Maimane says that holding the event while Zuma is president would be a waste of millions of rands. "Why should South Africans fund R11 million for an event that will be tabled by a president who has no mandate and ultimately will not be able to account for whatever pronouncements he makes on the day and that we should be party to that charade."
