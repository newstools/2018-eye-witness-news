Fitch says Treasury's plan to raise value-added tax to stabilise debt and rake in more revenue represents a partial reversal of recent fiscal deterioration. CAPE TOWN - There's a glimmer of hope that South Africa may be able to avoid further credit ratings downgrades. Ratings agency Fitch  says the rot at some state-owned companies remains a worry. But it adds Treasury's plan to raise value-added tax to stabilise debt and rake in more revenue represents a partial reversal of recent fiscal deterioration. Meanwhile, S&P Global is also optimistic about the country's economy under a new president. The agency's Konrad Reuss was in Cape Town this week for a post-budget event. “There’s a lot of goodwill out there now to get it right and to bring the economy back on a more sustainable growth path. However, it’s not going to be easy.”
