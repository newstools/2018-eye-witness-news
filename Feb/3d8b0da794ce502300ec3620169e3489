Opposition parties are unanimous in their disapproval of VAT being increase by one percentage point, saying this will impact the most vulnerable. JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties have reacted to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s budget, warning it will hit the poor the hardest. Parties are unanimous in their disapproval of VAT being increase by one percentage point, saying this will impact the most vulnerable. It’s the first such increase in more than two decades. Gigaba says the poor will find relief in zero-rated food items, but the opposition disagrees. Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane said: “What was clear and typically to be delivered by Mr Gigaba, who was at the centre of state capture, is that he asked poor people today to pay for the errors of the last nine years.” Inkatha Freedom Party Member of Parliament Mkhuleko Hlengwa said: “This budget signals that we’re not out of the woods. There are going to be negative ramifications for the majority of the people, particularly the poor people.” The United Democratic Movement’s Nqabayomzi Kwankwa said: “The government’s decision to increase VAT… we listened to the flimsy excuses and justifications that they gave us.” WATCH: #Budget2018: How you will be taxed  GIGABA DEFENDS VAT RISE Gigaba has said his Budget will cause economic pain but that its proposals, including a one percentage point hike in the VAT rate and cuts in state spending, are necessary to stabilise the country’s finances. He’s told Parliament that finding the billions needed to phase in fee-free higher education and training required significant changes to the fiscal framework. Gigaba’s defended the first increase in VAT since 1993. VAT will go up from 14 to 15%, a move Gigaba says will have the least impact on the economy. Along with 52 cents a litre fuel levy increase and other tax hikes, Gigaba says this will bring an extra R36 billion in revenue this year. Additional reporting by Gaye Davis.
