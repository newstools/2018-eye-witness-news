Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to brief the caucus on the steps that will have to be taken to remove President Jacob Zuma from office. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC)’s parliamentary caucus is still meeting behind closed doors at Parliament, although Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and some other ministers were seen leaving a short while ago. The meeting started at 10am on Thursday and top of the agenda was ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa.  He was expected to brief Members of Parliament (MPs) on his talks with President Jacob Zuma that are understood to be continuing as the party tries to negotiate a smooth transition and put an end to having two centres of power. National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and National Council of Provinces chairperson were also set to report back to MPs on Tuesday’s postponement of the State of the Nation Address (Sona). Also, on the agenda was a briefing by ANC MP Richard Mdakane, who has chaired a technical committee tasked with drawing up rules to give effect to the removal of a sitting president in terms of Section 89 of the Constitution. Meanwhile, the ANC has revised its programme for this weekend’s Nelson Mandela commemoration programme, removing Ramaphosa and party chairperson Gwede Mantashe from the schedule of events. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule is expected to brief media after the caucus meeting.  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
