JOHANNESBURG - A North West businessman who claims he was assaulted by an African National Congress (ANC) councillor says he was beaten up because they claim that he was allegedly bankrolling protests in the area. Obed Legobate has opened a case of assault against the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District Municipality’s MMC for Infrastructure and Technology. Legobate says that he was sjambokked and hit on the head with a sharp object after a heated argument with MMC Kgabo who had told him “to finish what he had started”. “They used sjamboks and I was cut with a sharp object. It was alleged that I’m sponsoring a group of youths who were marching against social ills.” Kgabo, who would not comment on the accusation, is expected back in court on 15 February for the alleged attack which happened in January.
