The parties succeeded in pressuring presiding officers to postpone the State of The Nation Address, which was scheduled for Thursday evening. JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties say they’re waiting for clarity around President Jacob Zuma’s future before deciding on their next move. The parties succeeded in pressuring presiding officers to postpone the State of The Nation Address (Sona), which was scheduled for Thursday evening. They had said they didn’t want Zuma to deliver the speech and demanded that a motion of no confidence in his leadership be debated. In another unexpected move on Tuesday, African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa cancelled the party’s special national executive committee (NEC) meeting which was expected to recall Zuma after a meeting with him, which has been described as fruitful and constructive. United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa says: “The instructions for the Speaker, are clear; we don’t want to be addressed by Zuma. Therefore, it’s clear that he will not address Sona. If he does not resign before we go back to Parliament, that would mean he’s defying his own party.” ZUMA DISMISSAL MORE COMPLEX On Tuesday, the ANC said that moves to remove President Zuma are nuanced. The party’s Khusela Diko said despite mounting pressure for the party to move against Zuma, it’s more complex than most think. At the same time, sources have told Eyewitness News that President Zuma will be recalled on Wednesday night if he doesn’t resign before then. They said if he refuses to go even after a decision is made, Members of Parliament will be instructed to vote in support of a motion of no confidence. Despite this, the ANC has already indicated that it does not want things to get to that level, as the party wouldn’t want to embarrass the president. Additional reporting by Regan Thaw.
