Amazon’s stock was down 1.14%, bringing its market capitalisation to $690.4 billion (£498.34 billion), while software maker Microsoft’s 1.83% fall depressed its market capitalisation to $690.3 billion. SAN FRANCISCO - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday was on the verge of ending the day with a stock market value higher than Microsoft Corp’s for the first time, as the online shopping behemoth weathered the recent turmoil on Wall Street. Amazon’s stock was down 1.14%, bringing its market capitalisation to $690.4 billion (£498.34 billion), while software maker Microsoft’s 1.83% fall depressed its market capitalisation to $690.3 billion. Bolstered by blockbuster quarterly results, Amazon’s stock gained 3.8% over the three sessions ended Tuesday, even as Wall Street struggled through a rout that has raised fears that a nine-year bull market may be ending. Microsoft lost about 3.1% over the three sessions ended Tuesday. Amazon’s market cap at points on Wednesday during intraday trade already topped that of Microsoft, but it has never closed at a higher value. Amazon’s explosive growth in retail and cloud computing has sent its shares 77% higher over the past year, outpacing Microsoft’s 42% rise. Apple Inc’s $819 billion market capitalisation remains Wall Street’s largest, followed by Alphabet Inc, the parent of Google, at $736 billion.
