JOHANNESBURG - The Stormers began their 2018 Super Rugby campaign with a hard fought 28-20 victory over the Jaguares at Newlands on Saturday, which was crucial in light of their tough three-week tour of Australasia. Robbie Fleckâ€™s men face the Waratahs at the Allianz Stadium before crossing the Tasman to face the defending champions the Crusaders at AMI Stadium, and finish off their tour with a clash against the Highlanders at Forsyth Barr Stadium. The Stormers romped to a 22-6 lead against the Argentine side inside 45 mins, but then took their foot off the pedal and allowed the dangerous Jaguares back into the game, something that Fleck will be concerned about going into the clash against the Waratahs. From the three matches on tour, the Stormers will be targeting at least two victories against the Waratahs and the Highlanders. The game against the Crusaders will be difficult and Fleck my target at least a losing bonus point and together with a possible two wins, the tour could be a deemed a successful one. Their depth at hooker will be tested on tour as they have only two fit players available in the position. Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi broke down at the last minute before the Jaguares game and was replaced by Ramone Samuels in the lineup, while Scarra Ntubeni is yet to recover from a hamstring injury picked up in preseason. The win against the Jaguares was crucial as it would have given the Stormers a great deal of confidence as it puts them at the top of the South African conference and top of the overall log after the first week of the competition.
