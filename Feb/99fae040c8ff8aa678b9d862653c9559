CAPE TOWN - The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) has collaborated with the Beijing Genomics Institute to established the continent’s first genomic sequencing facility. Construction at the African Genomics Centre is underway and is expected to be completed in June. Alterations in one’s DNA sequence can cause disease.
