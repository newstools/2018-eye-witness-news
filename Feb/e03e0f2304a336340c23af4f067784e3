JOHANNESBURG - Manchester United head into their Champions League round of 16 clash with Sevilla looking to preserve English clubs' unbeaten streak at this stage of the competition. Premier league rivals, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Liverpool have either won or drawn their respective last 16 ties over the last fortnight and United will hope they can keep that trend going. Jose Mourinho’s charges head into the game on the back of their 2-0 FA Cup win over Huddersfield Town on Saturday, while Sevilla claimed a 2-1 win over Las Palmas in La Liga. This will be United’s first appearance in the last 16 since 2014, while Sevilla were knocked out of the competition by Leicester at this stage last season. The night's other game sees Roma take on Shakhtar Donetsk, with the Italian side in good form, having won three games on the bounce in Serie A. Shakhtar currently sit top of the league in Ukraine but have only recently returned to action following a two-month winter break. The hosts, however, are playing good football in Europe's elite competition, finishing runners-up in group F, ahead of Italian side Napoli and have won three of their four games against Roma. Roma, on the other hand have lost seven of their last eight knockout games in Europe’s premium club competition. Both games are scheduled to get underway at 21:45.
