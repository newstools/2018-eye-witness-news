The R59 billion budget was finally passed on Tuesday after being rejected more than once due to the proposed electricity and water tariff hikes. JOHANNESBURG – Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says that while decreasing tariff hikes for water and electricity will cost the city almost R300 million, the compromise won't affect service delivery programmes. Mashaba had to decrease electricity tariffs from 7.37% to 7.1% and water tariffs from 14.2% to 13.2% for him to get the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) support to pass budget. The R59 billion budget was finally passed on Tuesday after being rejected more than once due to the tariff hikes.The DA’s Mashaba proposed the tariff hikes but the EFF fought back and sent the mayor back to the drawing board to reduce them. "As much as this has taken just close to just under R300 million from our revenue base, but if I look at our revenue generation plans, I’m convinced we’ll surpass our numbers." The ANC’s Jolidee Matongo has criticised the DA. "The DA needs the EFF and will do everything in their power to satisfy the EFF at the detriment of the citizens of Johannesburg." Mashaba says the changes won’t impact on the city’s service delivery programmes. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
