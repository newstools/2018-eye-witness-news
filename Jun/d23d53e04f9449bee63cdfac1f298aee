Hundreds of workers went on a rampage on Thursday over unpaid bonuses, and many patients were forced out of the building. JOHANNESBURG - Police remain on high alert at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital following Thursday’s chaotic protest. The hospital has confirmed services are back to normal and most of the rubble from the clashes has been removed. Hundreds of workers went on a rampage over unpaid bonuses, and many patients were forced out of the building. It’s eerily quiet at the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, where a number of police nyalas are either parked or moving around monitoring the area. The front gate is being manually opened by security guards when required. Spokesperson for the hospital Lungiswa Mvumvu says all services are running smoothly, but employees who are protesting are conducting their own meetings. “Employees who were protesting are meeting for an update on their grievances.” Mvumvu says patients who were turned away on Thursday were able to get their medication on Friday morning. “They collected their medication on Friday morning.” She says the disruptions which occurred on Thursday were driven by fear, and intimidated staff were asked to write statements, but some refused to do so.
