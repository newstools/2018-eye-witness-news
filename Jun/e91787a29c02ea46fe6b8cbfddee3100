Western Province Rugby President Thelo Wakefield says they are continuing to engage the City of Cape Town on the matter. CAPE TOWN - Western Province Rugby President Thelo Wakefield has told EWN Sport that Test rugby will not be moving from Newlands to Cape Town Stadium yet. Wakefield flatly denied media reports that this weekend’s Test between the Springboks and England will be that last international match at the iconic stadium. “Absolute nonsense, and those people that wrote that must please explain to the public because we don’t know anything about that. It’s absolutely nonsense. I cannot react on anonymous sources, people must get the real facts from us.” In the past, Wakefield has hinted at the possibility of uprooting rugby from the southern suburbs venue to the Cape Town Stadium. He says they are continuing to engage the City of Cape Town on the matter. “We are in discussions with the City of Cape Town and we are actually bound by a non-disclosure agreement. So, there is no ways that Western Province will breach that non-disclosure agreement.” The City of Cape Towns have openly stated their desire to have WP Rugby as an anchor tenant at the World Cup stadium. The city’s Asset and Facilities manager, Stuart Diamond, confirmed to EWN Sport that the possible move is far from decided. “There has always been discussions. At the moment, all these discussions and any decisions need to be discussed on a political and city council point of view and go through the relevant council processes. Those obviously have yet to take place. So, no, at the moment there is no decision with regards to Western Province Rugby moving to Cape Town Stadium.” Wakefield added that he expects Newlands to host more Test rugby in 2019. “All I can say that the latest rumours in the newspapers are unfounded, there will still be a Test at Newlands next year if SA Rugby grants us the Test. We are all 'shocked' that it’s the 'last' Test at Newlands. I don’t know who took that decision.”
