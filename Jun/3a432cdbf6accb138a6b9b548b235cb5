The Mackintosh building had been due to re-open next year after millions of pounds in restoration works following a May 2014 fire. GLASGOW, Scotland - A major fire has ripped through one of Scotland’s architectural gems, the Mackintosh building at the Glasgow School of Art, for the second time in four years, the Scottish fire service said on Saturday. The fire broke out late on Friday and more than 120 firefighters tackled the blaze during the night as it gutted the 1909 building and spread to two others nearby, a nightclub and a music venue. No casualties were reported. “This is an extremely challenging and complex incident, but the response and professionalism of our firefighters have been exceptional,” said Iain Bushell, deputy chief officer of the Scottish fire and rescue service. The Mackintosh building had been due to re-open next year after millions of pounds in restoration works following a May 2014 fire. “My first thoughts tonight are for the safety of people — but my heart also breaks for Glasgow’s beloved School of Art,” Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter. The Mackintosh building is named after its architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland’s most influential designer. The School of Art’s website says the building “heralded the birth of a new style in 20th-century European architecture”.
