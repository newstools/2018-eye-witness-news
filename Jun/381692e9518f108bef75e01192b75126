The mother of three was pulled out of a taxi in Mafolo on Wednesday and shot multiple times allegedly by her ex-boyfriend. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane  says she believes murder victim Nomsa Maduna would still be alive if the police had acted on the alarms raised about her safety in Soweto. The mother of three was pulled out of a taxi in Mafolo on Wednesday and shot multiple times allegedly by her ex-boyfriend. One suspect has since been arrested. A Gauteng government delegation has visited the family at their house on Friday afternoon. The family sit in a dark room in Mofolo central in Soweto. This is the house where Maduna was brought in a bid to keep her safe after she previously received threats on her life while staying in Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg. Nkosi-Malobane says she was made aware of Maduna’s fears for her life and police were tasked with following up. But she says it was too late. “I won’t pretend that it was never raised with me by the family after numerous cases were opened and no action was taken against this perpetrator.” The MEC says officers who failed to arrest Maduna’s ex-boyfriend when she first raised her concerns are being dealt with.
