Ace Magashule is addressing party members at the Limpopo elective conference which is being challenged in the High Court this afternoon. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress’ (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule has called for the party to be united ahead of next year's general elections. Magashule’s urged party members gathered at the party’s provincial elective conference in Polokwane this afternoon to forget about other issues for the time being. “Forget about differences, forget about our preferences - think about the ANC and the need for the ANC to win the upcoming general elections.” Meanwhile, lawyers representing a group of disgruntled ANC members in Limpopo  continue their arguments in the court this afternoon. The lawyers say they have approached the High Court in Johannesburg because the party’s national leadership endorsed an unlawful provincial executive committee to go ahead with the conference  which is currently underway. The court is hearing an urgent application to interdict the gathering. The group says the outgoing leadership is "illegitimate" and "unconstitutional and shouldn't continue to take executive and administrative decisions, as their term of office lapsed in February this year. Lawyers representing the group are arguing the conference is illegal and will appoint an illegal leadership structure should it go ahead. Advocate Dali Mpofu has told the court the current conference is being run by a nonexistent structure. “The failure to hear the merits of the dispute between the parties seriously compromised the appellant’s right to have a dispute to be determined in a fair hearing before a court of law.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
