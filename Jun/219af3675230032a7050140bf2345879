There have been several incidents of employees being intimidated and blocked from entering power stations by protesting workers, who are demanding a salary increase of 15%. Eskom has decided to cut increases altogether this year, saying that it simply doesn’t have the money.

Eskom says the wage dispute should be dealt with by the CCMA. CEO Phakamani Hadebe made it clear on Wednesday that the company has been battling financially.
