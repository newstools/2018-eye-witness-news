Steve Komphela fell out of favour with the demanding Kaizer Chiefs fans after he failed to deliver silverware to Naturena in three seasons in charge. JOHANNESBURG - Former Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has been confirmed as the new coach of Premier Soccer League club Bloemfontein Celtic on a three-year contract. Komphela was sacked as Chiefs coach following the Soweto club’s semi-final exit from the Nedbank Cup to eventual winners Free State Stars. Komphela fell out of favour with the demanding Chiefs fans after he failed to deliver silverware to Naturena in three seasons in charge. Celtic’s owner Max Tshabalala says he wants Komphela to rebuild the club and return them to the top 8, after finishing last season in 11th position. “Steve Komphela has a lot of credibility as a coach in South Africa, even though he has not won a lot of trophies. We feel like Steve is the kind of coach to fill our ambition and he will be able to rebuild the moral that has dropped in the team. Ultimately, we want to return to top 8 football.”
