JOHANNESBURG - The two Mpumalanga men convicted of forcing a black man into a coffin have been denied bail pending their leave of appeal. Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson were found guilty of assault and attempted murder in August last year and sentenced to 11 and 14 years behind bars respectively. The duo made headlines around the world when a video emerged showing them forcing Rethabile Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatening to set on fire. The pair were denied bail by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Friday. The NPA's Monica Nyuswa said: "The preceding officer stated that there are no compelling reasons why bail should be granted. The convicts in the coffin assault case wanted bail pending conviction and their sentence. The matter was heard on Monday where both parties agreed and argued." (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
