The Sunday Times is reporting that presenters, Kaunda Ntunja, Owen Nkumane, Xola Ntshinga and Gcobani Bobo have penned a letter detailing the institutional racism at SuperSport and it is also reported that the letter is now a subject of investigation by law firm Webber Wentzel. Last week, SuperSport announced its findings in the investigation conducted by senior counsel Advocate Vincent Maleka, that cleared Willemse’s fellow co-presenters Nick Mallet and Naas Botha of any racism, following Willemse’s live broadcast walkout last month.
