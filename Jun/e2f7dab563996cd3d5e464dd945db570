The party says its manifesto consultative workshop held on Monday is the start of preparations for the 2019 general elections. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) head of elections Fikile Mbalula says that the party wants to finalise its manifesto before the end of the year so they can shift their focus to electioneering. The party says its manifesto consultative workshop held on Monday is the start of preparations for the 2019 general elections. While the ANC committed to consulting broadly on its manifesto, Mbalula says that they also have to do performance assessments of its deployees in government and decide who should make the cut as candidates in the elections. "By the end of the year, all of this must be concluded. We can't have a situation where next year, where we're chasing time. Time must chase us. We don't know when the elections will take place, so whenever the elections come, we should be ready."
