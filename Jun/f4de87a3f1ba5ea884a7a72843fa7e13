The rehab facility will accommodate nearly 60 children who battle with drug abuse. JOHANNESBURG - A newly refurbished rehabilitation centre for children has been opened in Randburg. On Monday, Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba lead a city delegation to the official launch of the Golden Harvest inpatient treatment centre. The rehab facility will accommodate nearly 60 children who battle with drug abuse. The Golden Harvest Treatment Centre is the 3rd rehab facility Mashaba has opened so far in the city. He says the city plans to open more facilities in the coming weeks. “Before the end of this month, we’ve got plans to open two more, one in Alexandra and one in the inner city.” The mayor says drug abuse is one of the many problems destroying communities and drastic steps must be taken to tackle the scourge. “I truly believe that if we’re not going to get angry with what is happening, as the society, we’re not going to win the war against drugs.” The Johannesburg mayor says drug abuse in communities has reached unacceptable levels and intervention from both society and law enforcement agencies is needed. Mashaba says the country's justice system needs to also step up and prosecute drug lords. “We’re facing a huge challenge… a huge challenge as a result of law enforcement agencies actually is failing us.” This centre in Randburg will treat children from as young as 10 years old.
