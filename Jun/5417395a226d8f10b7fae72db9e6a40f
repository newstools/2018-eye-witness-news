Bourdain committed suicide in a hotel in France. LOS ANGELES - Barack Obama has paid a heartfelt tribute to Anthony Bourdain on Twitter. The former US President - who famously appeared on Bourdain's show 'Parts Unknown' in 2016 - has taken to social media to hail the influence of the celebrity chef, who committed suicide in a hotel in France, where he's been shooting scenes for his programme. Obama - who shared a $6 meal in Hanoi, Vietnam, with Bourdain during his appearance on 'Parts Unknown' - wrote on the micro-blogging website: "'Low plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.' This is how I'll remember Tony. He taught us about food -- but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We'll miss him."  Since news of Bourdain's death broke, a number of the chef's other famous friends have taken to social media to pay tribute to him. Chrissy Teigen - who recently took part in an episode of Chase Sapphire's 'Talking Travel' series - tweeted: "Anthony. One of my idols. Unapologetic, passionate and one of the best storytellers on the planet. Thank you for making food so exciting. And always standing up for everything right. Horrible. Why why why. Be at peace now :( (sic)" Fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay tweeted: "Stunned and saddened by the loss of Anthony Bourdain. He brought the world into our homes and inspired so many people to explore cultures and cities through their food."   Meanwhile, Jamie Oliver wrote on the micro-blogging website: "I have to say I'm in total shock to hear that the amazing @Bourdain has just died he really broke the mould, pushed the culinary conversation, Rest in peace chef thoughts and love to all his family and close friends xxxxxxxxxxx (sic)"  Bourdain - who died at the age of 61 - is survived by his 11-year-old daughter Ariane, who is his only child with his ex-wife Ottavia Busia.
