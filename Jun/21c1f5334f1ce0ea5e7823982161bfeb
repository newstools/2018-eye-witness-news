CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Social Development Department is donating sanitary pads to school pupils in Laingsburg and Beaufort West. It's part of the provincial government's plan to make these products are freely available to underprivileged girls, many of whom miss class during their menstrual cycle because they can't afford to buy sanitary pads. Spokesperson Sihle Ngobese says: “Access to sanitary pads makes a difference in the lives of girls, including ensuring their stay in school and dignity. As a ministry, we’re working to find more sustainable solutions to this problem.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
