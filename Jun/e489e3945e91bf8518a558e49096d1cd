JOHANNESBURG - The cost of sanitary products is a major concern for women around the world. Earlier on Thursday, a Member of Parliament in Britain highlighted the issue when she arrived late in the Commons. The Labour Party's Danielle Rowley told fellow MPs that she is currently menstruating and explained that on average, women in the UK will have to shell thousands of rands every year for sanitary products. “I would like to announce to you today and to the House, and perhaps you’ll excuse me for my lateness, that today I’m on my period – and it’s cost me this week already £25. We know the average cost of a period in the UK over a year is £500 – many women can’t afford this. What is the minister doing to address period poverty?”
