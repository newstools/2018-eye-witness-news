The agreement includes wage increases of between 6% and 7% depending on the position held by workers. JOHANNESBURG - Unions affiliated to the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) have signed the public service wage agreement after 10 months of negotiations. The agreement includes wage increases of between 6% and 7% depending on the position held by workers. It also stipulates that housing allowances for workers will be de-linked, meaning spouses will also be entitled to the allowance. Sadtu spokesperson Nomusa Cembi said: "These negotiations took place under very difficult conditions including the credit rating agencies threatening the sovereignty of our country. However, we managed to get such adeal.” Earlier this week, the Public Servants Association announced its members would go on strike this coming Monday in a so-called "day of rage". However, following Friday’s signing, the majority of unions have now agreed to the deal - rendering that planned strike illegal. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
