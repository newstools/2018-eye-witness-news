JOHANNESBURG - The Liberated Metalworkers Union of South Africa (Limusa) has welcomed the release of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill,  calling it a victory for workers. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi  on Thursday unveiled proposals aimed at bringing about universal health coverage in the country. One of the amendments to the Medical Schemes Bill is to abolish co-payments and brokers which Motsoaledi says will help make private healthcare more affordable. Limusa's Dloze Matooane said: “It is more about servicing the working class and the poor, it is more about the people than it is about capitalist’s ethics.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
