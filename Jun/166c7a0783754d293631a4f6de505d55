The economy contracted by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2018. JOHANNESBURG - In the face of worse than expected gross domestic product figures, some economists believe economic growth will pick up. The economy contracted by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2018. The sharp fall of 24% in the agriculture sector, along with declines in mining, retail and manufacturing sales dragged down growth. However, economist Goolam Balam says it will gradually start gaining momentum. "I think we will see the first quarter performance, or rather under-performance, as being an aberration and continued momentum built through the year and even into 2019." Analyst Azar Jammine agrees: "It isn't good news but I think one must not panic about it. It is a single quarter's figures and we have seen these figures influenced by seasonal adjustment processes. We have seen significant and revisions to these kinds of figures in the past."
