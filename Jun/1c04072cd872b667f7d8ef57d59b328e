Johnson has already served 21 years of a life sentence after she was convicted on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine and attempted possession of the drug. JOHANNESBURG - President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of Alice Johnson just a week after TV reality star Kim Kardashian-West pleaded her case in the oval office. Johnson has already served 21 years of a life sentence after she was convicted on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine and attempted possession of the drug. Now she's expected to be released from prison soon. CNN's Jeremy Diamond says: “Kardashian-West brought a little of celebrity appeal to the case that has been gaining popularity online with calls for an act of clemency on the president’s part and it appears her appeal was successful.” The 63-year-old one-time drug offender was sentenced to life without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, and the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has been trying to help get her released from behind bars since last year. Kardashian-West has reacted to Trump’s decision on Twitter.
