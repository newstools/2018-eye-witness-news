As part of the bail conditions they'll have to appear in court on all specified dates and have been barred from attending any sports or recreational events until further notice.

On this day, a pre-trial hearing will be conducted where outstanding issues will be raised and a trial date set. In the meantime, statements will be provided to the defence and the charge sheet will be amended. All 11 accused intend to plead guilty to all the charges. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
