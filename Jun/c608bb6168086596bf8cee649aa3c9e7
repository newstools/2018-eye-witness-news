JOHANNESBURG - Former Transnet boss Brian Molefe has been implicated in a legal draft forensic report for reportedly mismanaging funds and lying to the board during his tenure. The Sunday Times is reporting that Molefe may be facing criminal charges for various corruption and misconduct offences. The paper is reporting that the offences relate to the purchase of 1,064 new locomotives at the parastatal. The forensic report by Mncedisi and Ndlovu Attorneys says Molefe misled the Transnet board into approving costs.
