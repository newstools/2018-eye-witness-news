CAPE TOWN - The Blitzboks have arrived back in the country after clinching the world series title for the second consecutive year. They were given a heroes welcome. “I think my blood pressure is so high, it was really down to the wire. But never stop believing, have faith. That’s why we are the best in the world,” said one fan. “The boys know that I will support them through the failures. I will support them through the winning. When they win again next year I will be here again,” said another.  Captain Philip Snyman  lauded his team's performance in Paris last weekend. “We have a lot of injuries in the squad, five or six playmakers that [are] back home and to perform with our own guys that just shows the depth of the system.” WATCH: Blitzboks return home champions   (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
