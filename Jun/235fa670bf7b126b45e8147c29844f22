The 22-year-old Nkosi has had an eye-catching season for the Durban based franchise that has been rewarded with a run on debut in the crunch three Test match series against the English. JOHANNESBURG - Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus believes that Sharks winger Sbu Nkosi, who will make his Bok debut in the first Test against England in Johannesburg, could have made his international debut last year under Allister Coetzee. The 22-year-old Nkosi has had an eye-catching season for the Durban-based franchise that has been rewarded with a run on debut in the crunch three Test match series against the English. After not being included in the Sharks’ initial Super Rugby squads, Nkosi forced his way back into the lineup and has made telling contributions to the Sharks’ lacklustre season, notably his performance against the Highlanders in Durban, in which he scored a try and produced great displays of power and speed. Nkosi’s Springbok mentor believes that the youngster could have possibly made his debut for the green and gold as early as last season under the tutelage of former coach Coetzee. “I think Sbu was close to making his debut last year if I read the reports correctly, and I watched him when I was still in Ireland and he was one of the form wingers in the country.” Erasmus though, says that the Barberton-born Nkosi has some areas of his game that still need improvement but is excited about the physical attributes Nkosi possesses. “There are definitely still some areas that need some improvement in his game, like under the high ball. But he is progressing really well, and I am excited about the attacking attributes he has.” Nkosi is one of three debutants that will run out in the first Test, with Lions winger Aphiwe Dyantyi and Bulls lock RG Snyman being the other two players.
