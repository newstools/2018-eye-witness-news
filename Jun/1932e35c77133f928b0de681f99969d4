However, Bulo says Gauteng will remain cool this weekend with the cold front only expected to hit the region during the week. “We are expecting the weather to remain fine and cool in Gauteng. There’s another front which is coming and will mainly affect the Western Cape from 1 July. We are expecting heavy rain.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
