A group of disgruntled members approached the court claiming the process leading to this weekend’s gathering was marred by irregularities. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Johannesburg has struck an urgent application to interdict the African National Congress’s (ANC) Limpopo elective conference off the roll. A group of disgruntled members approached the court claiming the process leading to this weekend’s gathering was marred by irregularities. They say the outgoing leadership is "illegitimate" and shouldn't continue to take executive decisions, as their term of office lapsed in February this year. Judge Nana Makhubele delivered her judgement a short while go. Earlier, ANC secretary general Ace Magashule’s urged party members gathered at the party’s provincial elective conference in Polokwane this afternoon to forget about other issues for the time being. “Forget about differences, forget about our preferences - think about the ANC and the need for the ANC to win the upcoming general elections.” Lawyers representing the group argued allowing the conference  to go ahead would be a threat to democracy. Advocate Dali Mpofu says it's important for political parties to respect their own constitutions. “If this kind of thing is just allowed to happen it would be a threat to our democracy. Remember, our democracy is founded on a multi-party democracy. Let’s assume all South Africans decided they are not going to join political parties because they are run like this. This democracy would collapse.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
