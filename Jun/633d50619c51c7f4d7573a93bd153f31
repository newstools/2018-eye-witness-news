This means we are 4.0 millimetres above normal for May. The weather service adds that the total rainfall from January to date is 144.1 millimetres, and the long-term average is 134.1 millimetres. Therefore, we are 10.0 millimetres above average. Hydro-climatologist at UCT's Climate System Analysis Group, Piotr Wolski says May's rainfall average is better than the previous years. â€œAt this stage looking at the season, it will be fairly normal. This is good because it looks like a normal year. So that relieves a little bit of the stress of the water supply system. Although we are still in a water crisis." (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
