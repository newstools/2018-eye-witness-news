The National Tertiary Education Union's Jako Nel says they don't want a protracted strike for the sake of the students and workers. JOHANNESBURG - Students at Walter Sisulu University are in the dark about when exams will start amid an on-going strike by workers. Unions representing employees at the university have been in dead-lock wage negotiations with management for more than a week. Exams - which were supposed to start next week - have had to be rescheduled. But the university says as long as the strike is underway, it's unclear when exams can begin. The National Tertiary Education Union's Jako Nel says they don't want a protracted strike for the sake of the students and workers. “We want to avoid a six to eight-week strike because exams are starting. We have students that we have to get into the work environment.”
