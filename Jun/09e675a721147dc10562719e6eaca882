The horses - Silver, Venus, Misty, Jinx, and Vossie - were part of the city’s Equestrian Unit. They are now leaving the service due to age or medical reasons and have been handed over to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), which will be tasked with finding them new pastures for retirement. In April, the Service Animals Unit attended to 68 complaints on a range of charges including murder, and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “Their retirement comes soon after eight of their K9 Units colleagues also handed in their badges. These wonderful animals have gone about serving Cape Town with dogged determination and they’ve certainly not horsed around on the job,” an official said.
