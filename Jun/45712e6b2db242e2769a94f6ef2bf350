South Africa’s next assignment will be on Thursday when they take on New Zealand, with a place in the final still a possibility if the White Ferns lose both games on the day. JOHANNESBURG - After humiliating defeats to England and New Zealand in the T20I tri-series last week, the Proteas Women bounced back with a six-wicket win over the hosts at the weekend. England won the toss and elected to bat first with Tammy Beaumont once again leading the charge for her side with a blistering 71 from 59 deliveries. The opener was well supported by her skipper, Heather Knight, who scored 35 from 20 balls as the hosts posted 160/5 in their 20 overs. Shabnim Ishmail and Zintle Mali were the pick of the bowlers for South Africa, with two wickets apiece. In reply, South Africa got off to a shaky start with Laura Wolvaardt dismissed for a duck in the first over. Lizelle Lee and Sune Luus then combined for a brilliant 103-run partnership to put South Africa in a decent position at the halfway stage of their innings. Lee was the stand out performer with the bat scoring 68 from 37 balls, smashing 4 four’s and 6 sixes in the process. Luus was just as destructive in her innings, scoring 63 from 52 balls. Their outstanding partnership came to an end in the 12th over when Lee was dismissed by Anja Shrubsole, setting up a nervy second half of the innings. However, needing nine runs from the final over, Luus hit 2 four’s and a six off the first three balls as she led South Africa to their highest successful run chase in T20I. South Africa’s next assignment will be on Thursday when they take on New Zealand, with a place in the final still a possibility if the White Ferns lose both games on the day.
