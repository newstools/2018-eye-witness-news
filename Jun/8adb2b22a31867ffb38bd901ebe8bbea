It's unclear if the reported 4.7% wage offer has indeed been tabled by Eskom or whether unions will accept this hike after initially being offered 0% for this year. JOHANNESBURG – The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says Eskom  has now tabled a new wage offer of 4.7% for 2018. The NUM, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and Solidarity  have been in talks on behalf of their members with Eskom’s top management on Tuesday over the initial decision to cut salary increases altogether for the year. Workers downed tools last week and there were several reports of intimidation and damage to infrastructure which Eskom says resulted in load shedding. The unions have denied these allegations but have been determined to resolve the wage dispute. It's unclear if the reported 4.7% wage offer has indeed been tabled by Eskom or whether unions will accept this hike after initially being offered 0% for this year. However, NUM's spokesperson Livhuwani Mamburu took to social media earlier, saying the new wage offer was tabled on Tuesday along with a four-year agreement with inflation guaranteed. Negotiations between the NUM, Numsa and Solidarity are expected to continue until Thursday. Eskom says it would like to give the process a chance before making any public pronouncements. Numsa General Secretary Irvin Jim says unions understand the challenges facing the power utility, but further discussions need to take place to improve on the offer. “There is indeed a fair offer on the table in the best interest of workers of Eskom. We said we’re going back to reflect on the offer. And when we finally meet, we will not start with you [the media], we will start with Eskom and we will engage with Eskom and after those engagements, we will be able to communicate what is the final position.” At the same time, Eskom there's a likely chance of load shedding on Tuesday evening.
