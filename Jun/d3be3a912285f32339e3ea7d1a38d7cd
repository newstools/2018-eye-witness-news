JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) NEC has failed to select a candidate that will take over as North West premier, delegating the responsibility to the party’s national working committee that will sit on Wednesday. Eyewitness News understands that there was no consensus reached on any of the three names that were submitted by the provincial party. The North West ANC submitted the names of former director-general in the province Job Mokgoro, ambassador to the United Nations Jerry Matjila and Speaker of the provincial legislature Susan Dantjie to the NEC to choose who should take over from Supra Mahumapelo. EWN understands that the NEC couldn’t agree on one name and has rather tasked the party’s NWC to meet on Wednesday and take the final decision. It's understood that the highest decision making body also agreed that there must be a political solution to the divisions in the Eastern Cape and Free State, where disgruntled members want the court to dissolve the provincial leadership. The NEC wants the current provincial leaders to co-opt their opponents and include them into their structures of leadership, in order to resolve the current impasse. Regarding KZN, it is understood that the NEC has agreed that the dispute resolution committee must continue engaging the two factions in order to find common ground, saying that they want the conference to still take place at the end of July.
