LISTEN: Liberty working 'one step at time' to deal with hacking incident  The Information Regulator has called an urgent meeting with Liberty chief executive David Munro. The regulator says that South Africa has experienced a disturbingly high number of data breaches in the past few months. Tech Central editor Duncan McLeod says that the people responsible for stealing the data have uploaded some of it to a website and are threatening to reveal more, unless they are paid. “The statement that they issued through this website makes use of very poor English, which would suggest to me that the criminals might not be South African but may be from another country, such as Russia for example.” Liberty has assembled a team of security experts to investigate the intrusion.
