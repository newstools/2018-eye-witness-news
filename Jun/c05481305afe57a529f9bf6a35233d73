JOHANNESBURG - Experienced Springbok loose forward, Duane Vermeulen says he is happy to play a mentor role to the younger members of the Springbok squad in the three-Test series against England starting this Saturday. The Toulon based hard-man has played 39 times for his country but has been plagued by long-term injuries in recent times that have halted his Bok career. Now seemingly over his injuries, Vermeulen says that he is ready to play a mentor role to a relatively young squad during the June internationals against England. Vermeulen is likely to feature in a new-look loose trio, that will comprise of captain Siya Kolisi and possibly Tebogo Mohoje or Lions tear-away flanker Kwagga Smith. Another inexperienced player in the forwards, is Bulls lock RG Snyman, who could possibly make his debut alongside Pieter-Steph du Toit. There are more debuts expected in the backline, where Sharks and Lions wingers, Sbu Nkosi and Aphiwe Dyantyi are expected to be included for the first time in a Bok jersey. Vermeulen believes that he has an important role in mentoring the young players in the squad. “I have watched them play a bit in Super Rugby. There are a lot of youngsters and exciting new players and you have to spend a lot of time with them and I try to sit with a new guy everyday to try and find out what makes him tick on and off the field.” “I will definitely help wherever I can, on the field and off the field and try to make them understand the way we want to play.” The first Test against England kicks off at the Emirates Airline Park at 17:15 on Saturday afternoon.
