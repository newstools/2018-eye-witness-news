The Western Cape High Court will over the next two days hear whether a clause in the DA's constitution was fairly applied to de Lille. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court will in the next week hear whether a clause in the DA's constitution was fairly applied to Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille. The DA last month rescinded de Lille's party membership, saying she publicly declared she would resign from the party. The court has however suspended that decision pending the application being heard this week. The opposition party says it based its decision to oust the mayor on Section 3.5.1.2 in the party's constitution. It states a member ceases to be a member when he or she publicly declares his or her intention to resign and/or publicly declares his or her resignation from the Party. De Lille had told Capetalk and 702 host Eusebius Mckaiser she would walk away from the party once she clears her name. The former PAC and ID stalwart maintains she's the victim, with the DA dead set on removing her without proof that she's done anything wrong. The party argues she's lost the confidence of the caucus in council and is not fit to hold office. Last week, most of the council voted to strip her of her executive powers, which means she now only fulfils a ceremonial role. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
