The new safety and security enforcement unit will deal with acts of vandalism, theft and the illegal trade of non-ferrous metal and copper. CAPE TOWN - Metrorail says a new safety and security enforcement unit could tighten the noose on vandals. The City of Cape Town, the Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa) and the Western Cape government have agreed to split the R47,9 million cost to fund the unit which will be operational on a pilot basis for 12 months. It should be up and running within the next two to three months. The establishment of the unit was agreed to at a rail summit hosted by the City of Cape Town earlier this year. The unit will deal with acts of vandalism, theft and the illegal trade of non-ferrous metal and copper.  It will also increase visible policing on trains and stations. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker says the unit will help Prasa make its own Protection Services Department more effective. He adds it’ll also help with the enforcement the Criminal Matters Amendment Act. “Which was amended to ensure that there’s harsher punishment for people who are successfully prosecuted damaging the infrastructure.” The unit will operate on all lines across the city, but high-risk areas like the Central line will have a greater focus.
