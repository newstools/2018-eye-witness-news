NEW YORK - US President Donald Trump is doubling down on his “zero tolerance” immigration policy that has seen thousands of children forcibly removed from their parents at the Mexican border. Trump is due to meet with Republican lawmakers later on Tuesday ahead of two major votes on immigration legislation later this week as public fury over the separated families continues to grow. The US president remains determined to win funding for a wall he has long wanted to build along America’s Southern border with Mexico and continues to defend the immigration policy which provides for the arrest of all adults caught trying to enter the US illegally, even those seeking asylum. Images of children who are sent to separate detention facilities some in remote locations, when their parents are arrested, are being shared online as fury over the separation of families continues to build. Trump says the policy is needed to secure the border and deter illegal immigration.
