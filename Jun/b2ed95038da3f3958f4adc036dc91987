South Africa's captain says that New Zealand born Brad Shields will want to prove himself in his first England start. BLOEMFONTEIN - Springbok captain Siya Kolisi expects a backlash from Eddie Jones' English side in the second Test match at the Free State Stadium on Saturday. The Springboks produced a 42-39 victory in the first Test at Ellis Park, coming from 24-3 down inside the first 20 minutes. Kolisi believes England will come back strong in Bloemfontein and expects a big game from their forwards, including flanker Brad Shields who will be making his first England start following his Test debut in the first Test in Johannesburg. "We definitely know that this week will be different from England. We thought that they were good last week and this week they will come out with more determination. We are expecting another intense game from them and it will boil down to who wants it the most." Kolisi says that New Zealand born Shields will want to prove himself in his first England start. "I've played against Brad Shields in Super Rugby and he is very good in the wide channels, but he can also work towards the ball. It's his first start so he is going to want to prove himself and stay in the team for a lot longer." The second Test is going to be filled with plenty of emotion for Kolisi and the rest of the Springboks as it coincides with the country's Youth Day celebrations. President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in attendance, while it will also be Kolisi's 27th birthday and front rower Tendai Mtawarira's 100th cap for the Boks. Kolisi believes that this emotion will fuel the Springboks' performance. "It is obviously an important day in the country's history since it is Youth Day and it also being Beast's 100th Test. I hope we can channel that emotion in a positive way and use it to perform well against England." Kick-off at the Free State Stadium is at 17:05.
