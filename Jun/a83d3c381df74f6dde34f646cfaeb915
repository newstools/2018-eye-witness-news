It says its rating takes into consideration signs of recovering governance standards and the prospects of mild cyclical recovery. JOHANNESBURG - Rating agency Fitch has affirmed South Africa’s sovereign rating at BB+ with a stable outlook. Last month, S&P Global kept its rating unchanged – also at sub-investment grade. Fitch says South Africa’s rating is weighed down by a low growth trend, sizeable government debt and contingent liabilities. It says its rating takes into consideration signs of recovering governance standards and the prospects of mild cyclical recovery. The agency says it’s for this reason that the outlook has remained stable. But it notes that financial challenges at key state-owned enterprises “remain substantial”. Fitch says South Africa’s policy-making could be hindered by tensions within the ANC following legal challenges involving party provincial structures. But it has noted favourable government debt structure, deep local capital markets, a healthy banking sector and strong institutions.
