Some affiliated employees based at the Centurion distribution centre have been on strike for over a month now over wages. JOHANNESBURG - Workers affiliated to the National Transport Movement (NTM) are threating to embark on a shutdown of all Shoprite subsidiaries from Wednesday. Some affiliated employees based at the Centurion distribution centre have been on strike for over a month now over wages. It's understood drivers and warehouse workers are demanding a minimum monthly salary of R12,500 as well as a provident fund, medical aid and bonuses. The union says workers are currently earning about R400 a week which is unsustainable. Spokesperson David Maoto said: “We tried to negotiate with them several times, but they rejected our proposals. That is why we have taken the case to the CCMA and we have also received a certificate for strike action.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
