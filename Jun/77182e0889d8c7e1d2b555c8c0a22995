Woods’ game remains a work in progress but he issued what might be construed as his most ominous warning yet. An upbeat Tiger Woods matched his lowest score of the year when he fired a five-under-par 65 to move into contention just four strokes off the second-round lead at the Quicken Loans National outside Washington on Friday. The 14-times major champion set the tone for a storming round when his 25-foot birdie putt on the first hole found the dead centre of the cup on a warm and calm morning at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm in Maryland. In the American’s 11th tournament of the year on his comeback from spinal fusion surgery, Woods’ game remains a work in progress but he issued what might be construed as his most ominous warning yet. “As the year’s progressed, I think I’m not that far away from putting it together where I can win,” he said after posting a five-under 135 halfway total that left him in a tie for 11th. Americans Beau Hossler (66), Ryan Armour (65) and Brian Gay (64) share the lead on nine-under, one stroke ahead of compatriot Billy Horschel and Italy’s Francesco Molinari. Woods has shown glimpses of his old magic this year, most notably at the Players Championship in May, where he shot 65 on a par-72 course. But after missing the cut at the US Open a fortnight ago, he switched to a so-called “mallet” putter this week, which he says allows him to make a nice swing at the ball. “It’s a good feeling for me, just go ahead and trust it’s going to swing,” the 42-year-old said. “I don’t like blocking putts. I like feeling that toe move and cover that ball and it felt good today. “Yesterday (Thursday) I hit a lot of good putts. They just didn’t go in (even though I) started them on my line with the right pace. “Today I did that and a lot of them fell.”
