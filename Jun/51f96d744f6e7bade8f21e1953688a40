The new tournament is scheduled to start in December this year. JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa on Wednesday said that they do not intend on debating the issue of the disgruntled Global League T20 owners who have voiced their displeasure over the scrapping of the league last year and the formulation of a new one starting in December this year. According to Cricinfo, Nelson Mandela Bay Stars owner Ajay Sethi is the latest owner to speak out about his displeasure of the new league that CSA have launched in conjunction with sports broadcasting giants SuperSport. Although Sethi is reported to be happy with the new league, he is demanding that the owners of the franchises be kept in the new league or be payed for future profits and damages by CSA. If South Africa’s cricketing body doesn’t comply with those demands, Sethi will consider legal action against CSA. Cricket South Africa released a statement saying they will not debate the matter in the media. “CSA does not intend to debate the matter through the media and as per our last letter to the owners remain available to any party who wishes to engage in the current process of planning the tournament.” “CSA indicated from the off set that the key revenue streams must first be secured, like broadcasting rights and potential sponsors, before details of the tournament can be finalized.” The new tournament is scheduled to start in December this year.
