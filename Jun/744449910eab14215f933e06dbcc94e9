Unions representing staff are demanding an 8 percent wage increase, while management is offering 6.3 percent. CAPE TOWN - Exams at the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) have been postponed due to an on-going strike by workers. Unions representing staff are demanding an 8% wage increase while management is offering 6.3%. The National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu)’s Mcebisi Jojo says they are not sure how long the strike will go on for. “From the arrogance that we are getting from Rob Midgley [WSU vice-chancellor], it seems as if the strike could take a very long time. He must come back so that we can talk quickly, we are open for engagements. It’s not like we want to be on strike for the sake of being on strike, but we want to reach an agreement,” he said.
