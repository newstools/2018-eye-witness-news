The local TV personality received backlash and death threats after posting commentary referring to Gaza as a sh*thole. JOHANNESBURG - Shashi Naidoo has apologised for comments she made about Gaza, saying she will be visiting Palestine to educate herself. The local TV personality received backlash and death threats after posting commentary referring to Gaza as a sh*thole, which was later deleted, under an Instagram photograph of herself and DJ Black Coffee in Ibiza . Black Coffee ,who also received criticism for performing in Israel in April, was being criticised by one of Naidoo’s followers. Speaking at a joint media briefing with Pro-Palestine pressure group BDS on Wednesday, Naidoo said she felt the need to defend her friend (Black Coffee) and asked another friend to help draft an “educated response because my knowledge isn’t sufficient of the situation in Israel and Palestine”. Naidoo said she “idiotically” copied and pasted that response under her comments, which then garnered the negative media attention. A tearful Naidoo said she made a mistake and hopes that other people would also learn from her as she goes on this journey.
