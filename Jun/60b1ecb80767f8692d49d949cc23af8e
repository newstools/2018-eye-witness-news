Stan Mathabatha has been re-elected as the chairperson of the party in the province with Florence Radzilani elected as his deputy. CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa congratulated the newly elected leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo. Stan Mathabatha has been re-elected as the chairperson of the party in the province with Florence Radzilani elected as his deputy.  The president commended delegates for exhibiting a disciplined front despite the legal battles hanging over the procedures of the conference. “It will also be remiss of me not to commend the high levels of discipline and seriousness that you all as comrades displayed in the handling of this conference despite those who wanted to derail the conference.”  Ramaphosa says the significance of the conference in the ANC cannot be over-emphasized as it comes at a critical point in the life of the party. “This conference comes at a very critical time in the life of our movement as a number of processes are underway leading us to our appointment with the democratic process that our country has to have every five years.” Using the analogy of a choir singing in harmony, Ramaphosa took a moment to call the party to unity, pointing out the need for different leadership perspectives without descending in factionalism. “We need a mixed leadership; a leadership that has different perspectives [and] different approaches [and] voices to be brought together to enrich the processes of the ANC, so that we can move forward with real unity and renewal.” (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
