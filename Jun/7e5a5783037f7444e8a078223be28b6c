The Karoo Development Front's Noel Constable says they'll be tabling a motion of no confidence in the Beaufort West mayor and they're confident that they'll once again oust Japie van der Linde. CAPE TOWN - The Beaufort West Municipality is once again headed into stormy waters. The Karoo town's council has been in and out of the courts recently after the breakdown of an alliance between the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Karoo Democratic Force. The KDF joined forces with the opposition ANC earlier this year and pulled off a vote of no confidence in the DA mayor. But he's since been reinstated after the Western Cape High Court overturned the vote. Now the KDF is planning to try again with a new motion of no confidence in mayor Japie van der Linde. The Karoo Democratic Force's Noel Constable says they'll be tabling a motion of no confidence in the Beaufort West mayor and they're confident that they'll once again oust Japie van der Linde. "We don't have faith in the DA municipality. They are not in the majority. They are currently six and our coalition is seven. We're bringing his motion because of issues within the municipality." For his part, Van der Linde says he just wants to serve the citizens of the Karoo town and accuses the opposition of playing for power. "I'm sorry for our town because it's not a matter to come serve the people. People come serve their pockets. That's been happening the last four months and that's going to happen again. They'll steal until the town is under administration." The KDF says that the motion will be debated in council on 3 July.
