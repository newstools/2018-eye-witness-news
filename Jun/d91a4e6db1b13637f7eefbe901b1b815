CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says its departments are on standby following a warning from the South African Weather Service of high rainfall and gale-force winds from Thursday onwards.

The city says with the wind speed forecast to pick up late on Wednesday night, it is cautioning residents to be on alert for possible damage to their homes, trees that may be uprooted and could affect travelling and power lines. The city's Charlotte Powell says the disaster management centre together with other city services will remain watchful during this period. “The city has put in place measures to try to mitigate [against] the impact. Disaster response teams and engineering crews will be on standby to assist residents to deal with the consequences of these adverse weather conditions.”   (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
