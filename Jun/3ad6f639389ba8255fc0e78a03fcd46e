The latest version of the ICD was released on Monday to include the condition - which is characterised by “a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour which may be online or offline”. It adds the behaviour is severe enough to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
