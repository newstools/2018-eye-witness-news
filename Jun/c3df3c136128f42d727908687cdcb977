Africa’s last colonial power could not even secure the votes of the continent for the right to host the world’s most-watched sporting event in 2026. JOHANNESBURG - Morocco has been left wondering whether its money or morality that’s made it a five-time loser in its bid to host the football World Cup. Africa’s last colonial power could not even secure the votes of the continent for the right to host the world’s most-watched sporting event in 2026. The joint bid of the United State, Canada and Mexico to host the 2026 World Cup promises to earn $11 billion for Fifa, that’s more than twice what Morocco could’ve hoped to score. At best Morocco spends many times what it could afford to maintain its illegal occupation of Western Sahara. The disappointed kingdom once again has to consider the reality that once faced the apartheid regime and that’s no normal sport is possible in an abnormal society.
