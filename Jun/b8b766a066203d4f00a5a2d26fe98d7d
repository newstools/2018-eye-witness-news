Uber's general manager in sub-Saharan Africa Alon Lits says they will continue to hold discussions with drivers and monitor the petrol price and other cost increases. JOHANNESBURG - Some Uber and Taxify driver partners say it’s unacceptable that Uber fares have not been increased since the e-hailing service came to South Africa four years ago. A group of operators went offline on Monday over the issue, saying they’re barely making ends meet with escalating fuel prices and the recent value added tax increase. Uber's general manager in sub-Saharan Africa, Alon Lits, says they will continue to hold discussions with drivers and monitor the petrol price and other cost increases. “We’ve got a number of deals for drivers where they can get rebates on fuel, discounted insurance, discounted maintenance, deals for cellphone contracts. These are all costs and we’re working on ways to reduce costs.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
