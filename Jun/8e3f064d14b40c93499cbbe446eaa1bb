Saica announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be using KPMG to audit the organisation after the auditing firm resigned. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica) says its parting with KPMG was a mutual decision for both organisations. Saica announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be using KPMG to audit the organisation after the auditing firm resigned. This follows the institutions beginning an inquiry into current and former KPMG-employed chartered accountants. The auditing firm has come under fire because of its handling of Gupta accounts. Acting Saica CEO Fanisa Lamola said, “We can’t continue because of the inquiry so it was decided that KPMG not be any part of Saica in any way.”
