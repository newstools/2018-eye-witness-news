CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) says a house has been burned to the ground after a blaze in Cape St Francis, in the Eastern Cape, over this past week.

The institute’s Craig Lambinon says: “The fire department was able to extinguish the blaze but sadly the house was razed to the ground and no further assistance from NSRI was required.”
