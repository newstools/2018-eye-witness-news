From Wednesday, a litre of petrol will cost you back 82 cents more, while diesel is going up by 85 cents a litre. JOHANNESBURG - With the fuel price going up more than 80 cents a litre at midnight, trade union federation Saftu is warning that the latest increase will have a far reaching impact on workers who are already under strain. From Wednesday, a litre of petrol will cost you back 82 cents more, while diesel is going up by 85 cents a litre. Illuminating paraffin will set you back an extra R1,09 cents. Saftu's Zwelinzima Vavi says that while everything is going up, many workers' salaries aren't. "Workers are getting a serious pounding. We're getting poorer at a time where [wage] increases cannot match up. All the deals we are finding are way below that."
