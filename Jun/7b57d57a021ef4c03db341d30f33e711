This is the first time since 1938 that Germany have failed to progress to the knockout stages of the World Cup. JOHANNESBURG - The 2014 World Champions Germany crashed out of this year's World Cup in the group stages following their 2-0 loss to South Korea on Wednesday. This is the first time since 1938 that Germany have failed to progress to the knockout stages of the World Cup and will not defend their title they won four years ago in Brazil. Germany went into the game under massive pressure to win against South Korea in order for them to progress, but the Germans squandered plenty of chances to put the ball past goalkeeper Woo Choo who produced a clinical display in goal for the Koreans. Sweden also compounded Germanyâ€™s woes when they thrashed Mexico 3-0 in the other Group F game, which meant that they and Mexico progressed to the last 16. The loss also sees Germany finish bottom of the group with Japan finishing in third place.
