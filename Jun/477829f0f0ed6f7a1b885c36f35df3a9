Commuters using Golden Arrow buses will be affected by the recent fuel price increase as bus fares are set to go up next month. CAPE TOWN - Commuters using Golden Arrow buses will be affected by the recent fuel price increase as bus fares are set to go up next month. The Department of Energy announced that the fuel price will rise by 82 cents a litre and diesel will cost between 85 and 87 a litre from Wednesday. The company's Bronwen Dyke says the fare increase is inevitable. “The company is no longer in a situation to absorb these costs escalations and will therefore adjust fares in the coming months. This increase is unavoidable given the prevailing economic climate.” (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
