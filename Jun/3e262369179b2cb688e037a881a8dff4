Authorities say tyres were set alight by protesting residents along the N7 highway. CAPE TOWN - The situation in Dunoon has returned to calm after an anti-land invasion operation led to protest action earlier on Sunday afternoon. Authorities say tyres were set alight by protesting residents along the N7 highway. The demonstration led to a section of that road being closed to traffic. Law enforcement officers had been monitoring the scene. City of Cape Town’s law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said: “Currently, it’s all quiet now. Our officers along with the Housing Department officials removed about 15 unoccupied structures and they were incidents of sporadic tyre burning.”
