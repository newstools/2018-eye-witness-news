Several protesters suffered serious injuries, including skull fractures, when more than 20 public order police officers opened fire with rubber bullets during a protest on Wednesday. JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) has condemned what it's labelled police brutality in Eersterust  following service delivery protests in the Pretoria township. Several protesters suffered serious injuries, including skull fractures, when more than 20 public order police officers opened fire with rubber bullets during a protest on Wednesday. Sixty-one-year-old Arthur Moses died in his home, allegedly after inhaling tear gas. The Citizen photographer Jacques Nelles was shot with a rubber bullet in the back, while senior reporter Virginia Keppler broke her leg and ankle while running for cover. Pretoria News reporter Sakhile Ndlazi also took a rubber bullet to the back of his head. Sanef’s Kate Skinner says journalists must be able to report without fear or favour and in circumstances that protect their safety. “If journalists are covering service delivery protests, they must be able to do it in a context of safety because you’re not gonna get the stories that we need to put out, particularly in a pre-election and election period.”   (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
