She is going into the meeting in Brussels having failed to reach an agreement with her coalition partners who are insisting on turning back asylum seekers. PRETORIA - German Chancellor Angela Merkel  is under increasing pressure as the European Union (EU) goes into a divisive summit on Thursday  dominated by the issue of migration. She is going into the meeting in Brussels having failed to reach an agreement with her coalition partners who are insisting on turning back asylum seekers. Merkel accepts that European leaders won’t reach agreement at the summit on the rescue of European-bound migrants at sea and how and where to settle those already there. Her coalition partners don’t see any need to grant her more time to arrive at a domestic arrangement. She’s insisting the fraught issue has to be dealt with at a European level where she is getting an equally rough ride. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
