JOHANNESBURG - A Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officer involved in a crash in which a woman and her two children were killed is expected to appear in court on Wednesday. The off-duty police officer was drunk when he collided into the woman on the Golden Highway on Sunday night. The JMPD held a briefing on Monday where it apologised to the family of the deceased. JMPD chief David Thembe said: “To the families of the deceased, we humbly request that you accept our apology. I’m not going to allow JMPD officers to portray a bad reputation of the department, because one potato spoils the whole bag.” The officer has been charged with culpable homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol.
