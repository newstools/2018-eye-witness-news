On Thursday, the Cape Town Council voted to strip her of those powers and she now has only a ceremonial role. CAPE TOWN – Embattled Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says that she will continue to fight to have her executive powers reinstated. On Thursday, the Cape Town Council voted to strip her of those powers. She now has only a ceremonial role. De Lille says that going to council for permission on every decision is like walking around with a pass book in apartheid. She says she will now go back to court to have all her executive mayor powers reinstated. “Because every decision now, where there is not consensus, needs to be escalated to a full council meeting. So we're going to have a lot of Mayco meetings. If we don't agree in Mayco, then we must call a council meeting.” The motion was brought by deputy mayor and Democratic Alliance caucus leader, Ian Neilson. A total of 137 voted in favour and 50 against. The African National Congress (ANC)'s Xolani Sotashe says the move is a sign of desperation to get rid of her. “To strip the duly elected mayor of Cape Town of her powers vested in her by the supreme law, it is illegal.” The ANC also says it will open a criminal case against councillors who voted for the motion, because it claims the decision was unlawful.
