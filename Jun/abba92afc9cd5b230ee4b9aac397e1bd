Some of the areas which saw these protests include Parkwood, Mitchells Plain and Vrygrond.  Meanwhile, police will continue monitoring the situation in Thembalethu, George, where there have been protests since Tuesday. Demonstrators are demanding the municipality improves service delivery and provide water and sanitation services, as well as adequate electricity supply and refuse removal services. Two cargo trucks were burnt during protests on Tuesday night, while roads were blocked. The municipality says the Go George bus service, which was hampered by the protest, has returned to normal. The police’s Malcolm Poje says eight people have been arrested for public violence. “The situation has stabilised… it still needs to be normalised but our members are maintaining high visibility in the area to contain the situation and act upon if there are any unrests. There are sporadic incidents of stone throwers.”  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
