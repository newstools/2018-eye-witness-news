The ANC now says that all regional conferences must sit by this weekend. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has backtracked from its announcement that regional conferences in Gauteng have been suspended. As the ANC's NEC met on Monday, party members from the West Rand region gathered outside the venue, raising concerns over alleged irregularities at branch general meetings ahead of this weekend’s regional conferences. This is what ANC secretery-general Ace Magashule said yesterday. "We have decided to postpone all regional conferences in Gauteng that were supposed to take place this weekend." But ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe claims that Magashule's comment was taken out of context. "What the secretary-general was saying was taken out of context because there is no conference in Gauteng that is being stopped, cancelled or postponed." It seems that Magashule's announcement wasn't sanctioned by the party’s highest decision making body. The ANC now says that all regional conferences must sit by this weekend.
