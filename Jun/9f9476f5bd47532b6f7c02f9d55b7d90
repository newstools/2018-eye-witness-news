The North West has been through a lot over the past few months, from violent service delivery protests and a crippling strike in the health sector. Mokgoro has told Eyewitness News that he understands that he has a tough job ahead. "I guess there are many matters that need leadership attention and this principally in my view are matters that affect 3.8 million people in the province." Mokgoro has served as director-general in the North West government and head of the National School of Government.
