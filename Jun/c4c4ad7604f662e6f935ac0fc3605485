The Springboks had to battle from a 21 point deficit inside the 20 mins of the first half, to eventually win the first Test. JOHANNESBURG - England coach Eddie Jones believes that Siya Kolisi captaining the Springboks in the 42-39 first Test victory at Emirates Airline Park on Saturday was a momentous occasion for rugby in South Africa. The Springboks had to battle from a 21 point deficit inside the 20 mins of the first half, to eventually win the first Test and take a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series with games in Bloemfontein and Cape Town still to go. Kolisi led the Boks out for the first time on Saturday and became South Africa's 61st Test Captain. The England boss was glowing in his praise for Kolisi and the Springboks performance against his side. "As much as I am disappointed about the loss, I am very happy for Siya Kolisi for being the first black Captain of the Springboks." "I thought it was a momentous occasion for South African rugby and for rugby in general. There was a lot of belief in Kolisi and they showed it in their performance tonight." As glowing as Jones' praise was of the Bok performance, he also says that the Ellis Park charm aided the Boks. "I thought they had a get out of jail free card tonight. Ellis Park is always a great place for the Boks to play their rugby and that aided them tonight." Jones believes that his side will bounce back strongly in the second Test in Bloemfontein as they try and level the series at 1-1.
