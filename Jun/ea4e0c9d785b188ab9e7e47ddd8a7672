According to officials, over the past six weeks nearly 2,000 families have been separated at the border crossing. NEW YORK - Former US first lady Laura Bush has joined the growing outcry over President Donald Trump's immigration policy which is splitting up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border. According to officials, over the past six weeks, nearly 2,000 families have been separated at the border crossing. Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, Bush, wife of former president George W Bush, condemns Trump’s zero-tolerance immigration policy as heartbreaking, cruel and immoral. The current first lady, Melania Trump, too expressed concern through her spokesperson, saying she hates to see children separated from their families. The first ladies’ comments come amid growing alarm over the policy while on Monday UN  human rights chief Ra'ad Zeid al-Hussein called on the US to end what he terms its “unconscionable” strategy of forced separations.
