A three-year wage deal was signed in principle between government and public servants but it’s not yet come into effect after some unions pulled out. JOHANNESBURG - The Public Servants Association (PSA) says it will be going on a nationwide strike next Monday after wage talks deadlocked with government. In May, a three-year wage deal was signed in principle between government and public servants but it’s not yet come into effect after some unions pulled out. The salary adjustments over the three-year agreement range between 6% and 7% depending on the employee's level and includes a restructured housing allowance. The PSA's Tahir Maepa says they want the deal to be scrapped. “The current three-year deal is suggesting that our members are going to get lesser and lesser as the three years go. The current 7% for the lowest paid is ridiculous having to consider the fact that there was a VAT increase.” Treasury has flagged the Public Service Wage Bill as an imminent risk to government spending and has urged against salary increases exceeding inflation.
