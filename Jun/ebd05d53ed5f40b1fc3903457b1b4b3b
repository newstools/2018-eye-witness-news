Drivers say that it is unacceptable that fares have not increased in the wake of the escalating costs in fuel prices and VAT but that their pay has stayed the same. JOHANNESBURG - Some Uber and Taxify partnered drivers will apparently be offline from Monday over salaries. Drivers say that it is unacceptable that fares have not increased in the wake of the escalating costs in fuel prices and VAT but that their pay has stayed the same. The Movement's Teresa Munchick has called on drivers in the sector to stand in solidarity with their demands. "We're calling for an increase in fares. Fuel has gone up substantially over the years, the cost of vehicles, the cost of insurance... everything has gone up and its really outrageous that we haven't had an increase." Uber says that it is unaware of any disruptions to services and is verifying these claims.
