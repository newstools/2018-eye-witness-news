The migrants will be transferred from the rescue ship Aquarius to the Italian vessels that will make the 1,400 kilometre trip to Valencia. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has rounded on Italy’s new Home Affairs minister Matteo Salvini for breaking international law and creating the stalemate that left the rescued migrants stranded at sea.
