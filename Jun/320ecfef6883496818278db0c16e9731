The unions rejected Eskom's 4.7% offer but didn't give details of their proposal, saying that the situation is delicate. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is set to tell unions on Thursday morning if it accepts their counter proposal after the utility's wage increase offer was rejected. The NUM, Numsa and Solidarity met with Eskom on Wednesday to discuss the company's four-year offer, which includes a wage increase of 4.7% for this year and an inflation-based increase for the next three years. The unions rejected this but didn't give details of their proposal, saying that the situation is delicate. Numsa's Irvin Jim says he hopes for a breakthrough today. "If the feedback is good, if we think it makes sense, we might have to take it back to the members. If the feedback is not looking good, we might have to take a view as to what our attitude towards it is." The NUM's Helen Diatile: "We have to go and humble ourselves to the members and tell them what has transpired. So for us it's an opportunity to be bale to consult with our membes and tell them what is going on and why." Solidarity's Tommy Wedder-Spoon says it was a challenge to get all unions to agree on a single proposal. "I think the good news is that the trade unions have consolidated their positions, that was the hardest part, coming from three different entities."
