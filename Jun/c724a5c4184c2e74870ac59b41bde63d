The City of Cape Town has been made to pay one of its employees R80,000 for unfairly excluding him from a shortlist for one of four area-based manager posts. CAPE TOWN - A City of Cape Town executive director, who allegedly amended the recruitment criteria for four senior posts, is looking to leave the city with a clean record. Leon Scheepers, the executive director for area-based service delivery, informed the city at the start of his disciplinary hearing this week that he would be resigning. But after a heated debate behind closed doors on Thursday night, EWN understands the city council refused to agree to his terms. The City of Cape Town has been made to pay one of its employees R80,000 for unfairly excluding him from a shortlist for one of four area-based manager posts. In testimony to the bargaining council, Scheepers alleged Mayor Patricia de Lille forced him to water down the qualifying criteria for the jobs. De Lille has denied Scheepersâ€™ version of events, on which the Democratic Alliance (DA) launched a second disciplinary process against her in April, saying she has nothing to do with city job advertisements. In a resignation letter seen by EWN, Scheepers says he will walk away from his job immediately if the council withdraws the charges or drops the disciplinary action against him. The city has told EWN it could not immediately respond to request for comment on what action it plans to take. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
