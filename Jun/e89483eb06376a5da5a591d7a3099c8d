Earlier in May, the ANC councillor Andile Lungisa was granted bail after having served 16 days of his two-year prison sentence for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) Port Elizabeth councillor Andile Lungisa says he is continuing with his work as he prepares to appeal his conviction and sentence for assaulting a Democratic Alliance (DA) member in 2016. Earlier in May, Lungisa was granted bail after having served 16 days of his two-year prison sentence for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The charges stem from a chaotic Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting, almost two years ago, where Lungisa hit Rano Kayser over the head with a glass jug. Lungisa says it’s still unclear when his appeal will be heard. “We’re waiting for the judge president to allocate a judge to attend to our appeal.” He says while he can’t speak about the merits of his case, he strongly believes he was acting in self-defence. “On the video that was circulated, people can be seen moving from their seats. Three men from the DA attacked me without provocation. I only defended myself.” In the meantime, while out on bail, Lungisa is continuing with councillor duties. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
