JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa (CSA) has welcomed the interest shown by former franchise holders of the defunct T20 Global League to be involved in CSA’s new franchise-based T20 competition. In the last few days, numerous Global League T20 franchise owners had hit out at CSA for their mismanagement of the league that was supposed to start last year but was postponed because CSA was facing a R180 million revenue loss. A new league has since been formulated by CSA in conjunction with sport broadcasting channel SuperSport, in which the franchise owners have also said that CSA has tried to exclude them from the new league that is due to kick off in December. CSA acting chief executive Thabang Moroe said they welcome the interest shown by the franchise owners in the new league. “The fact that they want to be part of it is an encouraging response, and this confirms that they believe, as we indeed do, that our new T20 is a good product that compares with the best international standards. At the same time, it is essential that we follow the process in the development of our T20 strategy, which in the first place, required us to resolve the outstanding issues from last year. “As has been well documented, the key to the postponement was the inability to secure key stakeholders and revenue streams. We have now secured a broadcasting equity partner and are currently engaging potential sponsors. Once those parties are secured as a collective the business plan will be finalised. We will then be in a position to clarify what we can propose and offer to other stakeholders,” concluded Moroe.
