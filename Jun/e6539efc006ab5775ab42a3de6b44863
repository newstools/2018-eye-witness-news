Eleanore Bouw-Spies faced a motion of no confidence on Wednesday night. CAPE TOWN - Another Democratic Alliance (DA)-led municipality has been thrown into disarray after Knysna's mayor was voted out of office. Eleanore Bouw-Spies faced a motion of no confidence on Wednesday night. The DA’s Mark Willemse was unanimously voted in as her successor. Ricky van Aswegen from Congress of the People now serves as the deputy mayor of the town. The African National Congress (ANC) tabled the motion against Bouw-Spies, saying she had not performed her duties. The DA’s Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela has described the vote as a coup, and claims they were unaware that DA members in the Knysna council were going to vote along with the opposition. “The only way to describe that is that it was a coup. It is outrageous what happened in Knysna, without any prior warning from those members in the DA. They just decided to side with the opposition and elected themselves as mayor.” He condemned the election of the new mayor. “He’s the Speaker of the Eden District. He colluded with members of the opposition and decided that they must elect him as mayor. That is totally unacceptable.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
