CAPE TOWN - The young Springbok side faltered at a wet and windy Newlands England ran out 25-10 winners as they managed the challenging weather conditions much better than their hosts.  After an attritional first half which saw England take a 6-3 lead. The second 40 minutes had more action as the Boks scored the first try of the Test thanks to a deft chip from Warwick Gelant which Jesse Kriel dotted to take the lead.  That would the last time South Africa saw the lead as England had full control of the territory - they converted their field positions into points as Jonny May scored a try while the metronomic Owen Farrell kicked penalty after penalty. The English deserved their win in conditions more familiar to them than the altitude of the previous two Tests. South Africa take the series 2-1 but will know they have work to ahead of the Rugby Championship later this year. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
