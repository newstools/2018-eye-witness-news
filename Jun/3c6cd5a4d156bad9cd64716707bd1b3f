Mr Price posted diluted headline earnings per share of 1,075 cents ($0.0847) for the year-ended March 31, versus 887.9 cents in the corresponding period last year. JOHANNESBURG - South African clothing retailer Mr Price Group posted a 21% rise in full-year earnings, boosted by its MRP Apparel, Miladys and MRP Money divisions, the firm said on Friday. Mr Price, known for its no-frills clothing and furniture stores, posted diluted headline earnings per share of 1,075 cents ($0.0847) for the year-ended March 31, versus 887.9 cents in the corresponding period last year. Headline earnings per share is the main profit measure in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items. Mr Price, which has grown for more than three decades by undercutting competitors and catering to thrifty shoppers’ fashion needs, said retail sales increased 7.6% to R20 billion while comparable store sales rose 5.6%. “This was a solid performance by a dedicated and talented team, who re-focused and delivered after the under-performance of the previous year,” Chief Executive Officer Stuart Bird said in a statement. Mr Price, which also sells homeware and furniture, is facing increased competition from international chains including Zara, H&M and Cotton On and has lost market share as local competitors, such as the restructured Edcon, mark down stock. Mr Price declared a final gross cash dividend, down 5.6%, of 414.10 cents per share for the period ending 31 March, but saw annual per share dividends increase by 3.9% to 693.1 cents.
