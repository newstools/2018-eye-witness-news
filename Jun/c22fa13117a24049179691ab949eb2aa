A handful of De Lille supporters flocked to her side as she arrived ahead of her latest court action over her initial dismissal. CAPE TOWN - Some Cape Town residents gathered at the Western Cape High Court have mixed feelings about Mayor Patricia de Lille's court battles with the Democratic Alliance (DA). A handful of De Lille supporters flocked to her side as she arrived ahead of her latest court action over her initial dismissal. De Lille is continuing her fight against the DA, challenging the party’s cessation clause that saw her being ejected from office last month. De Lille says it’s time for this debacle to come to an end as it’s affecting service delivery.  She was last week stripped of her executive powers, reducing her to a ceremonial mayor. These residents have varying views on the matter. “No one is above the law, she’s got a constitutional right to fight for her rights. And therefore, I support her,” said one resident. “I don’t think it will ever change. I don’t think anything will ever happen about it,” said another. “I don’t see a reason to kick that woman out,” another resident said. The hearings have been set down for Monday and Tuesday.
