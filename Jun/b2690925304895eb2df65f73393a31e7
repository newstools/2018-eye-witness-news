Mkhize says the killing of councillors impacts on local government. “There’s a tendency we’re beginning to see where the murders of councillors and the stability of council… there are irregularities and interference with procurement processes. All of these issues need to be nipped in the bud.” He says that preventing these murders also become a serious expenditure problem for municipalities as guards have to be organised for councillors.
