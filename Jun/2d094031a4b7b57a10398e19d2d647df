JOHANNESBURG - The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) has welcomed the decision by the Limpopo government to place the Modimolle–Mookgophong Local Municipality under administration. The union has accused the DA-led coalition of failing to deliver services and at times not paying workers. Samwu provincial secretary Patrick Aphane says the intervention is much needed. “There is a lot not paid on time, it means the financial and administrative systems in that municipality are not up to scratch. And they might have been corruption going on. That’s why we want that municipality to be placed under administration and we welcome the decision of the provincial government in that regard.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
