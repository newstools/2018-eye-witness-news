National Treasury gave Eskom the green light to sign new contracts with suppliers, however, this process is taking time. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says that it is still negotiating "reasonable" coal prices with potential new suppliers as it tries to deal with low stockpiles at some of its power stations. The utility says the situation remains stable at six of its coal fired power stations at the moment, as excess coal has been diverted to the areas where it was running low. National Treasury gave Eskom the green light to sign new contracts with suppliers, however, this process is taking time. Eskom’s Khulu Phasiwe explains says: “The discussions are still ongoing. This follows the approval we have received from National Treasury and our board. The fact that we have permission to sign the contracts doesn’t mean we should be reckless, so our team is still negotiating with the mining houses to ensure we get a reasonable price.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
