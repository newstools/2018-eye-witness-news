CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town will deploy a mobile unit to Woodlands  in Mitchells Plain following violent housing and land protests. The city's Assets and Facilities Management mobile unit will assist residents with registering and updating their details on the city's housing database. On Monday, protesters clashed with police, vandalised and looted a fuel station and several shops after authorities removed 20 illegally erected structures. According to the City of Cape Town, there are currently more than 20,000 people from Mitchells Plain on its housing database. Officials met with disgruntled residents who were involved in the land invasions, the Community Policing Forum and ratepayers' associations on Tuesday. Mayco member Eddie Andrews says the city strongly condemns any public violence and is taking action to address residents' grievances. “We respect the right of residents to protest but this should be done peacefully. The meeting resolved that the city would ensure that a team is deployed to the Woodlands community centre to assist residents with their registration and also updating their details under the city’s database.” The most recent city housing development in Mitchells Plain was in 2011 when more than 1,800 people received housing. Andrews says there are currently two active City of Cape Town housing projects in Mitchells Plain, the Beacon Valley Housing Project and the Highlands Housing Projects.
