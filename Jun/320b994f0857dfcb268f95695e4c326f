The union's Gauteng leadership has slammed the minister for his comments on Thursday's protest by staff at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG â€“ The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) wants Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi to step down. The union's Gauteng leadership has slammed the minister for his comments on Thursday's protest by staff at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg. Motsoaledi described the actions of the staff as hooliganism after the group emptied bins across hallways and caused other damage to the health facility. The union has accused Motsoaledi of failing to address health worker's grievances, like the dispute over unpaid bonuses. Denosa says Motsoaledi's comments were unfortunate and reactionary and is urging the minister to step down before the chaos escalates to other facilities and affects more patients. At the same time, the South African Medical Association says while it acknowledges the grievances of workers its called for issues should be addressed through discussions and negotiations.
