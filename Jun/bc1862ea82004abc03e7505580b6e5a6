Rob Davies says some of the corruption cases had to be dropped by the Hawks because of a lack of evidence to achieve beyond reasonable doubt convictions. CAPE TOWN - The Hawks are struggling to solve several corruption cases reported by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). This has been revealed by Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies in a written parliamentary reply. Davies says out of 24 corruption cases reported to the police by his department under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, 20 have been closed for various reasons, including inability to locate key witnesses. Davies says some of the corruption cases had to be dropped by the Hawks because of a lack of evidence to achieve beyond reasonable doubt convictions. The departmentâ€™s National Empowerment Fund has the most corruption cases, with 13 matters referred to the Hawks. The unit told Parliament earlier this year when criminal cases had been identified, there was a lack of sufficient evidence and the non-availability of relevant documents to corroborate evidence. Davies says the chief directorate in his department makes monthly follow-ups with the Hawks on all cases to monitor their progress. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
