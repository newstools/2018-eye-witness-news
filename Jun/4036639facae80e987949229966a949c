WATCH: Malmesbury community shocked by mosque attack  The motive for the mosque attack remains unclear at this stage. Ismail Bassa was one of the worshippers killed. He was at the mosque for Itikaf, an Islamic practice where men retreat to the mosque for the last 10 days of the month of Ramadan. Bassa lived next to the place of worship. Bassa, who was in his 70s, is on Thursday afternoon being laid to rest, according to Muslim rites. His wife Zainab Bassa says the mosque was like a second home to her husband. “I do not want to see anybody slaughtered in the mosque. My husband was… for 10 days staying in the masjid for Itikaf.”  ATTACKER UNKNOWN Malmesbury residents say the attacker is unknown to them, adding he came to the mosque looking for a place to stay for the night as he was on his way to Vredenburg. However, without warning after 3am he started stabbing fellow worshippers. Meanwhile, the attacker’s body has been removed from a field where he was shot dead.
