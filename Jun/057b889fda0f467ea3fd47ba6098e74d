El Nino is a warming of ocean surface temperatures associated with crop damage, fires and flash floods. GENEVA - There is a 25% chance of El Nino weather conditions returning in the third quarter of 2018, but the likelihood of a weak El Nino in the fourth quarter looks about 50/50, the UN World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday. El Nino is a warming of ocean surface temperatures associated with crop damage, fires and flash floods. The WMO said a continuation of the current neutral weather conditions was most likely for the coming quarter, with no chance of La Nina, a generally cooling phenomenon. The last El Nino was linked to a severe drought that hit crop production and economic growth across southern Africa, and the region is still emerging from its effects two years later.
