WATCH: President Ramaphosa addresses ANC members on manifesto  Hundreds of ANC leaders, deployees in government, activists and academics gathered to come up with a plan that the ANC can present to South Africans as its manifesto.  They were divided into nine working groups dealing with different topics, ranging from economic transformation to land and agrarian reform. There is also a commission on crime and corruption. Addressing the opening of the workshop, Ramaphosa called on delegates to be frank and open in their discussions. “If you think certain statements may hurt the leadership of the ANC, please do not hold back.
