JOHANNESBURG – Comrades Marathon amputee runner Xolani Luvuno says that running has helped him turn his life around. Luvuno, who is a recovering drug addict and a cancer survivor, completed the race on crutches before 4:30 in the afternoon on Sunday. He says that the marathon required a lot of training. “It helped me to turn my life around because I used to be an alcoholic, going to parties. So I see myself not partying anymore, instead concentrating on my running.” He had this to say at the finish line: “I wanted to make sure that I finish before cut-off time and my coach said to me don’t rush because the Comrades Marathon is not 42km, it’s a big race. I want to say thank you to the supporters who cheered for me on the route, as well as the director of the Comrades Marathon for giving me this chance.” Organisers allowed Luvuno to start five hours early to allow him to finish before 6pm. The marathon started at dawn on Sunday morning, with Bongumusa Mthembu winning the men’s race and Ann Ashworth finishing first in the women’s race. (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
