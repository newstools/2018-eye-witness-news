CAPE TOWN - An alleged gangster has been shot dead in Bonteheuwel  in what appears to be a revenge killing. The victim's body was found near the train tracks at Bonteheuwel Station on Wednesday morning. His death comes after the murder of a rival gang member in the area two weeks ago. Ward Councillor Angus McKenzie says gangsterism is a major problem in the community. “This is extremely concerning and, as a community, we are seemingly fighting against a brick wall. And I would really urge the minister to read the open letter that I gave him because we desperately need his assistance in policing the gangsterism that is taking place in Bonteheuwel.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
