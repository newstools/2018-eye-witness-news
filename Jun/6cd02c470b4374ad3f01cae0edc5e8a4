Emmanuel Macron said an agreement has been found as he left talks that began on Thursday evening and lasted until dawn on Friday. BRUSSELS - European Union leaders reached an agreement on migration after almost 10 hours of chaotic talks in Brussels over the sensitive issue threatening their union and zone of free travel, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. “EU28 leaders have agreed on (summit) conclusions, including on migration,” the chairman of the talks Donald Tusk said. Italy has earlier blocked any agreement at the summit - which was also about trade and security, among other things - unless EU peers meet its demands over migration. French President Emmanuel Macron said a hard-fought deal reached by leaders on migration showed “European cooperation” had prevailed over national interests. “After nine hours of discussions, an agreement has been found. It is European cooperation that has won the day,” Macron said as he left talks that began on Thursday evening and lasted until dawn on Friday. “Europe will have to live with migratory pressures for a long time. We must succeed in standing up to this challenge whilst being true to our values.”
