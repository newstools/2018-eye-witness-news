Stage one load shedding could be implemented from around five o'clock on Tuesday depending on how the system is able to cope with electricity demand. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  has warned that there's a very high chance of load shedding this evening. Stage one load shedding could be implemented from around 5 pm on Tuesday depending on how the system is able to cope with electricity demand. The parastatal says various problems, including last week's industrial action,  are to blame for the implementation of rolling blackouts. Eskom’s Khulu Phasiwe said: “Unfortunately, tonight the power system is looking severely constrained and as a result, there is a big risk that there must be load shedding from 5 pm this evening until about 9 pm.” Workers went on a one-day strike over the utility’s decision not to increase their salaries this year. Unions are demanding a pay hike of between 9 and 15%. At the same time, the City of Cape Town says it cannot confirm whether there will be blackouts in the city over the next few days. Mayco member Xanthea Limberg says the municipality is dependent on Eskom for information and they have not yet indicated whether there will be load shedding. “If Eskom alerts us to that and indicates there will be implementing load shedding, the city will then follow through and communicate with residents as soon as possible. And once again redirects residents to the schedule which they can find on the City of Cape Town website.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
