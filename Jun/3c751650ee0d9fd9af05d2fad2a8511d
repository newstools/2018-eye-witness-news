JOHANNESBURG - International Cricket Council CEO Dave Richardson has urged Qatar based television station Al Jazeera to present cricket’s governing body with their evidence of corruption in cricket, so they can conduct a thorough investigation. Al Jazeera flighted a documentary of their undercover investigation into spot-fixing and pitch doctoring at the highest level in cricket a week ago that has shocked the cricketing world. The documentary implicates some international players in taking bribes and for being involved in match-fixing in recent times. Al Jazeera also alleges that a whole new tournament that is a front for match-fixing is being planned and will be staged in the UAE. In a statement, Richardson has urged the channel to present the ICC with their findings in order for them to conduct an investigation into the claims. “I ask Al Jazeera to release to us all the material they have relating to corruption in cricket. We will conduct a full, thorough and fair investigation and will ensure no stone is left unturned as we examine all allegations of corruption made in the programme. To do so, we need to see all the evidence they state they possess. “I am encouraged by their public commitment to cooperate and now ask that they do so, in releasing all relevant material. We understand and fully respect the need to protect journalistic sources and our ACU team have worked with other media companies on that basis. However, to prove or disprove these allegations, we need to see the evidence referred to in the programme.”
