Some media reports in the United Kingdom suggest Benni McCarthy is a front-runner for the vacant managerial post at St. Mirren in Scotland. CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City chairman John Comitis has told EWN Sport that as far as he knows, coach Benni McCarthy will still be at the club come next season. Some media reports in the United Kingdom suggest McCarthy is a front-runner for the vacant managerial post at St. Mirren in Scotland. Comitis says McCarthy he has been in constant contact with McCarthy on holiday and there is no reason to believe he will be believing. “I heard he is going to Chiefs, I heard he is going to Supersport, then I heard he is now at St. Mirren. I can’t comment because every time I speak to the coach, which was about 48 hours ago, we were discussing players and how we were going to start the season. I can’t comment unless it comes from Benni.” Comitis has also been left frustrated in the transfer market during the offseason. “We are busy trying to get signings but trying and getting them are two different things. I’m perturbed a bit, because nothing is happening, nobody is reacting but we have our targets set for one or two players and hopefully, we can complete them by June.” While Comitis also confirmed he is interested in South African Haashim Domingo, 22-year-old scored four goals for Portuguese clubs Vitoria de Guimaraes B this season. “We did make an attempt to see if we can engage Haashim Domingo, however, there are a few uncertainties with Haashim. We don’t know how he would be at the top flight, I think he is a great player. There are no such things as trials with players coming back from Europe and unfortunately, we are also competing against Bidvest Wits”
