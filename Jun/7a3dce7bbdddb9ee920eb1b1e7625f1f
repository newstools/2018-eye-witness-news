JOHANNESBURG - City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has suspended one of his councillors for publicly declaring that the city is a friend of Israel. Health and Social Development MMC Mpho Phalatse made the comments at the South African Friend of Israel national conference at the weekend. This is what Mpho Phalatse said at the weekend. "I am a friend of Israel and the City of Johannesburg is a friend of Israel." Mashaba says he was disappointed that the councillor attributed her personal remarks to the city.
