Lungisa insists during the entire incident he was protecting himself. JOHANNESBURG - It's unclear when ANC Port Elizabeth councillor Andile Lungisa's appeal against his conviction and sentence will be heard for assaulting a da member. Earlier this month, Lungisa was granted bail as he prepares to apply for leave to appeal his two year prison sentence for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The charges stem from a chaotic nelson Mandela Bay council meeting almost two years ago, in which he hit Rano Kayser over the head with a glass jug. Kayser sustained serious injuries. Lungisa insists during the entire incident he was protecting himself. â€œAndile Lungisa was standing, he did not attack anybody. Three DA councillors moved to him and a lamp post was used and I only defended myself when I was under attack.
