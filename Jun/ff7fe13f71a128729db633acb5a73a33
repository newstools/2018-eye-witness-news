New cases of the virus have spiked in recent months in Europe. With only six days to go until the soccer extravaganza, health experts have warned people to get their measles vaccine ahead of the World Cup. The World Health Organisation reported that in 2016 there were 89,000 measles deaths globally. People exposed to measles begin having signs 10 - 12 days after exposure. Symptoms include a runny nose, red and watery eyes and a cough. Measles vaccination resulted in an 84% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2016.
