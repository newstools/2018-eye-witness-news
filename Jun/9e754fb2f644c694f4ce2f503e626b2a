The provincial Education Department says three classrooms at the Ditau Secondary School in the Bushbuckridge Local Municipality were destroyed in the latest blaze. JOHANNESBURG - Another school has been torched in Mpumalanga - bringing to four the number of schools targeted in the province since last week. The provincial Education Department says three classrooms at the Ditau Secondary School in the Bushbuckridge Local Municipality were destroyed in the latest blaze. Spokesperson Jasper Zwane said: “We are therefore appealing to our communities to identify those who are behind this. Someone must be found and be arrested and be convicted to a long jail term. It can serve as a deterrent but also to send a message that such actions are not condoned.” It follows similar arson attacks last week following a by-election that didn't yield a favourable outcome for some residents. Angry residents set buildings at two different schools alight at the Dr JS Moroka Municipality. A school in the North West was also torched last week. More than 20 state schools have been attacked in protests nationwide this year so far. On Tuesday Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga  called for harsher sentences for people convicted of damaging schools. Motshekga said the department spends millions on repairing damaged infrastructure caused by protesters. At the same time, the South African Human Rights Commision (SAHRC) has condemned the destruction of schools and other infrastructure. The commission says the destruction of educational institutions strips children of their right to a basic education. Additional reporting by Tendani Mulaudzi and Graig-Lee Smith.
