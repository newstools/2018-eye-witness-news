Bavuma, who is the first black South African batsman to score a Test hundred for Proteas, is back at the Johannesburg franchise after spending one season at the Cape Cobras. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas batsman Temba Bavuma will captain the Bizhub Highveld Lions in all three formats when the 2017/18 domestic cricket season begins in the summer. Bavuma, who is the first black South African batsman to score a Test hundred for Proteas, is back at the Johannesburg franchise after spending one season at the Cape Cobras.  The diminutive right-handed batsman will be assisted by fellow right-handed batsman Rassie van der Dussen as they hope to lead a young Lions side back to the glory days of winning domestic trophies. Bavuma and Van der Dussen complete a new leadership structure at the Lions as Enoch Nkwe was also revealed as the new head coach in May following the redeployment of Geoffrey Toyana to a talent identification and recruitment role at the Lions.
