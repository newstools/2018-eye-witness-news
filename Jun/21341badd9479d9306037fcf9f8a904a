One of Gun Free South Africa’s arguments centres around access to guns. The organisation's Adele Kirsten said: “The evidence shows that when you reduce access to these guns or gun theft and work with stronger guns laws, we half our gun related deaths.” John Welsh from the Gun Owners’ Association of South Africa disagrees. “The issue, in our view, is not the firearms, the issue is people. What Gun Free SA mentioned with regard to corruption and training and competence. We agree with that.” Meanwhile, the teenager's family says it believes the father's explanation.
