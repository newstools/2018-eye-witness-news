ANC caucus leader Phumelele Ndoni says Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip must spend more money on the poor. CAPE TOWN - Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) councillors are expected to vote on the municipality’s budget next week. The city’s R12 billion budget was not voted on this week because opposition parties were not satisfied with how funds were allocated. The African National Congress (ANC) says not enough money has been allocated to townships. ANC caucus leader Phumelele Ndoni says NMB mayor Athol Trollip must spend more money on the poor. “All the areas, all the townships that have been in the past neglected should get a fair allocation so that we are able to deal with the backlog in terms of infrastructures and many of the things that are service delivery related.” Mayco member for finance Retief Odendaal says they remain confident that the 2018/2019 budget will pass next week. “The budget will be reconsidered next week with pertaining to ward councillors and ward-based priorities.” The Democratic Alliance needs 61 votes to pass the budget.
