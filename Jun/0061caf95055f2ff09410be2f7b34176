Melania Trump has been accused of distracting people from Donald Trump policy by wearing ‘I really don’t care’ jacket during her first visit to a shelter housing immigration children in Texas. CAPE TOWN – First Lady Melania Trump’s visit on Thursday to a Texas shelter housing migrant children separated from their parents was overshadowed by a jacket she wore with the words: “I really don’t care, do u?” scrawled in white brush strokes on the back. Melania Trump was shown in photos wearing the hooded green khaki jacket designed by fashion chain Zara as she boarded a flight. She had it on again when she left the aircraft upon returning to Washington DC later in the evening. Twitter users took to the social media network to express their anger. One user asked: “What the hell kind of grown ass woman wears a jacket meant for an angry teenager who is trying to piss off her parents or her teachers to go take pictures with kidnapped refugee children?” The price of the jacket also came into the spotlight as one user claimed the whole event was planned to distract the world from Donald Trump’s policy. “How many $39 jackets do you think the wife of a supposed billionaire owns? This was Planned to distract us. I'm nearly certain of it.” The president ordered federal agencies on Thursday to begin reuniting immigrant families at the US-Mexico border, but his efforts to roll back a policy that drew global condemnation were beset by confusion. On Wednesday, when signing the executive order to reverse the policy on separating children from parents, Donald Trump cited his daughter and his wife as influencing his decision.
