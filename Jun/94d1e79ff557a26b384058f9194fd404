Cynthia Masina says she is disappointed that it’s taking so long to decide on whether to prosecute Tom Moyane for the assault of her daughter. JOHANNESBURG - The mother of a 17-year-old girl who claims she was assaulted by suspended South African Revenue Service (Sars) boss Tom Moyane says she only wants to see justice served for her daughter. The Director of Public Prosecutions in Johannesburg is still considering a final decision on whether to prosecute Moyane. Friday’s decision by a state prosecutor in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court not to charge Moyane with assault is now under review. The teen claims she was kicked and tackled last week by Moyane, who is her child’s grandfather. Cynthia Masina says she is disappointed that it’s taking so long to decide on whether to prosecute Moyane for the assault of her daughter. “We’re just relying on justice. I don’t know how I’ll face my daughter if justice was to fail us.” A medical report of Masina’s daughter seen by Eyewitness News shows a doctor at the Helen Joseph Hospital concluded on 15 May that injuries to her face, neck and stomach correlate with a history of assault. Masina says her daughter is not coping in the wake of the attack. Moyane’s lawyer has welcomed the preliminary decision not to prosecute him for alleged assault. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
