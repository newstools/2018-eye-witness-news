Disgruntled ANC members in Limpopo say the process preceding the conference was unlawful as the term of office for the provincial executive committee lapsed in February 2018. JOHANNESBURG - Lawyers representing a group of disgruntled African National Congress (ANC) members have argued in the High Court in Johannesburg that the continuation of the elective conference in Limpopo will have irreversible consequences for the people of that province. The court is currently hearing an urgent application to interdict the gathering. The group says the process preceding the conference was unlawful as the term of office for the provincial executive committee lapsed in February this year. Advocate Dali Mpofu says it's important for political parties to respect their own constitutions. “If this kind of thing is just allowed to happen it would be a threat to our democracy. Remember, our democracy is founded on a multi-party democracy. Let’s assume all South Africans decided they are not going to join political parties because they are run like this. This democracy would collapse.” At the same time, the ANC has questioned the motives of disgruntled members to interdict the party's Limpopo conference, saying the unknown group may be attempting to collapse the organisation. The party says it’s noted the expense of taking major organisations to court, which has left it wondering who is behind the application. Spokesperson Pule Mabe says: “Who are these people putting a lot of money, sometimes millions of rand, towards those who take political parties - especially the ANC- to court? These could just be agents acting to liquidate the organisation. (Edited by Masechaba Sefularo)
