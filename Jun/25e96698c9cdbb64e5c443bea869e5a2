DULUTH – President Donald Trump said North Korea had returned on Wednesday the remains of 200 US troops missing from the Korean War, although there was no official confirmation of the move from military authorities. “We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains sent back today, already 200 got sent back,” Trump told a crowd of supporters during a rally in Duluth, Minnesota. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that in coming days North Korea would hand over a “sizeable number” of remains to United Nations Command in South Korea, and they would then be transferred to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii.
