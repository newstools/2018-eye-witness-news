The SACP has concluded their three-day central committee meeting in Johannesburg. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Communist Party (SACP) has concluded their three-day central committee meeting in Johannesburg. The meeting heard an address from African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday while Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi gave a detailed account of the countryâ€™s public healthcare system. Under Jacob Zuma, the SACP and the ANC had a frosty relationship with the communists threatening to break away from the ANC led alliance. Now, they seem to be mending fences, pledging to work together for the 2019 elections. While Zuma may not have been the focus of this meeting, he still caused divisions in the SACP. The City Press is reporting that one of the party leaders, Themba Mthembu, landed in hot water for inviting Zuma to a government event. Party leader Blade Nzimande is under pressure to act on Mthembu for defying the SACP and inviting Zuma for his budget vote in the KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislature. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
