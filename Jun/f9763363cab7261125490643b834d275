JOHANNESBURG - Tammy Beaumont notched up a maiden T20 International century as England broke the record for the highest T20 score in women’s cricket. The English posted a mammoth 250/3 in the tri-series match against the Proteas women in Somerset on Wednesday. The total was set up by a brilliant 116 from Tammy Beaumont, that included 18 fours and 4 sixes. Beaumont and opening partner Danielle Wyatt (56) put on 147 for the first wicket as the Proteas Women had no answer to the host’s blistering start. In response, South Africa came nowhere near the total as they were restricted to 129/6 in their 20 overs to lose by 121 runs. Captain Dane van Niekerk led from the front with a gutsy 72 from 51 balls, but it was not enough to prevent a second defeat of the day for South Africa. The first came at the hands of New Zealand, who had surpassed Australia’s highest T20 total of 209, when they smashed 216/1. The star of the show was New Zealand opener Suzie Bates who tore into the South African attack with a magnificent 124 from just 66 balls. Like Beaumont for England, Bates was well supported by her opening partner Sophie Devine (73) as the pair put on a record opening stand in all T20I cricket of 182. At the time, the White Ferns held the record for the highest T20 and ODI scores, following their 490/4 against Ireland last week. The Proteas Women found the total beyond their reach as they were bowled out for 150 to lose by 66 runs. A bad day all round for Hilton Moreeng’s chargers, who will be looking to bounce back when they play England on Saturday afternoon.
