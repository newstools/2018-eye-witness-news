The board named Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan as the interim chief executive officer. BENGALURU - Intel Corp on Thursday said Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich has resigned, effective immediately after a probe revealed that a past consensual relationship with an Intel employee violated company policy. “An ongoing investigation by internal and external counsel has confirmed a violation of Intel’s non-fraternization policy, which applies to all managers,” the company said in a statement. The board named Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan as the interim chief executive officer. Krzanich had been in the role since May 2013. Intel said its board has begun a search for a permanent CEO, including both internal and external candidates, and will hire an executive search firm to assist in the process. The company also forecast better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and profit. Shares of the company rose 2.1% to $54.59 in premarket trading. Intel said it expects quarterly revenue of about $16.9 billion and an adjusted profit of about 99 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $16.29 billion and an adjusted profit of 85 cents per share.
