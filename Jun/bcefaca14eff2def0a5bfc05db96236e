Steinhoff said the support letters for Steinhoff Europe AG and Steinhoff Finance Holding GmbH took effect on Wednesday and underlined creditors’ support for a restructuring plan. JOHANNESBURG - South African retailer Steinhoff, which has been embroiled in an accounting scandal, said on Wednesday it had received creditor support letters for two companies it used to finance its overseas business. Steinhoff said the support letters for Steinhoff Europe AG and Steinhoff Finance Holding GmbH took effect on Wednesday and underlined creditors’ support for a restructuring plan. Creditors agreed to interim support measures until 30 June, as well as agreeing to subordinate around $181 million of their contractual rights against the two firms, Steinhoff said in a statement. Steinhoff aggressively expanded in developed markets since moving its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt in 2015, snapping up Britain’s Poundland, US-based Mattress Firm and Australia’s Fantastic. The company, whose retail chains also  Conforama in France, has been fighting to recover from the fallout from accounting irregularities discovered in December. This sparked a sell-off in its shares that wiped more than $10 billion off its stock market value and led to multiple investigations globally. In May, the group said it had repaid approximately 2 billion euros of African debt since January 2018. Steinhoff has been under investigation for suspected accounting irregularities by the state prosecutor in Oldenburg, Germany since 2015.
