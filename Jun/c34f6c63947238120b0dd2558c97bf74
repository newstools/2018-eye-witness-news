Jamba Ulengo is back at wing, Hanro Liebenberg at no 8 and Jannes Kirsten makes a first appearance this season on the side of the scrum. JOHANNESBURG - The Vodacom Bulls will travel to the Singapore National Stadium for their Vodacom Super Rugby clash against the Sunwolves with a number of new faces as well as a new captain in flyhalf Handre Pollard this weekend. The playmaker takes over from regular captain Burger Odendaal who was not considered due to injury, in a side that welcomes back a number of players who saw little action this year. Jamba Ulengo is back at wing, Hanro Liebenberg at no 8 and Jannes Kirsten makes a first appearance this season on the side of the scrum. Ulengo and Kirsten have not played at all in this year's tournament and Liebenberg's last action was on 14 April against the Cell C Sharks. The midfield combination, where Johnny Kotze will partner with Jesse Kriel in Odendaal's absence, is new as well, while Pollard will have Embrose Papier on his inside. Papier last started on 23 March against the Crusaders. Edgar Marutlulle, Simpiwe Matanzima and Morne Smith will all make first appearances for the season as well, with the latter two also debuting in the competition in Vodacom Bulls colours. Kick-off is at 13h35 SA time.
