According to reports, a woman gave birth to a baby boy last week Tuesday and a nurse took the infant away for a bath but never came back with the child. JOHANNESBURG - There are calls for Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa to investigate the alleged abduction of a baby at the Stinkwater Public Clinic in Pretoria. According to reports, a woman gave birth to a baby boy last week Tuesday and a nurse took the infant away for a bath. The mother was then told the baby had died. The Democratic Alliance (DA) says shortly afterwards a nurse informed the mother that her baby had simply disappeared from the clinic. DA Gauteng north regional chairperson Abel Tau says police have refused to open a case. “There are no answers for the family and it’s the unfortunate part. We have a young mother who has lost a baby and is in this situation where no one is willing to give answers or give a hearing or even point to where the baby is if anything.” DEPARTMENT DENIES The Tshwane Health Department has denied claims that the baby was abducted from the clinic. The department has moved to clarify the woman gave birth five months into her pregnancy and the foetus was declared unviable as it weighed only 300 grams. Maternity programme director Lekwetji Komane says the woman was shown the foetus before it was disposed of. “The foetus was registered in a register so there is a record for an entry of the particular patient. We are still busy with investigations. We haven’t concluded.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
