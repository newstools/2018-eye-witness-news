The wheelchair-bound author and scientist died in March aged 76, but his family says the commemoration also fulfils his wish of wanting to go in to space. LONDON – The words of world-renowned British physicist Professor Stephen Hawking are being beamed into space today after a thanksgiving service as a "message of peace and hope". The wheelchair-bound author and scientist died in March aged 76, but his family says the commemoration also fulfils his wish of wanting to go into space. Professor Hawking’s ashes are to be interred in Westminster Abbey in London between Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. The thanksgiving service is being attended by friends and family and 1,000 members of the public who applied for seats in a ballot. Afterwards his words, which have been set to an original score by composer Vangelis, will be beamed towards the nearest black hole. The satellite broadcast will feature readings and addresses from people including actor Benedict Cumberbatch and British astronaut Tim Peake.
