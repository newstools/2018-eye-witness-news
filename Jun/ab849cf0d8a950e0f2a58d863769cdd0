JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana advanced to Cosafa Cup Plate final with a 4-1 victory over Namibia in Polokwane on Tuesday. The home side were dumped out of the main competition on Sunday, losing on penalties to Madagascar. Midfielder Lebohang Maboe was the star of the show as he bagged a first-half brace and the man of the match award to give South Africa a shot at lifting silverware against Botswana in the final. Maboe started well as he attempted a long range effort after spotting the Namibian goalkeeper of his line in the first minute. South Africa did get on the score sheet in the 24th when Maphosa Modiba converted his penalty. Maboe then scored his first goal of the match in the 26th minute. Namibia then came to life as they forced Bafana goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse to make a one-handed save in the 34th minute. Pieterse, though, was beaten four minutes later as Deon Hotto netted in the 38th minute. Maboe, though, restored the two-goal lead with his second goal of the match in the 40th minute. Bafana captain Siyanda Xulu added a fourth goal in the 53rd minute to seal the side's final berth. The final is a repeat of the 2016 Cosafa Cup final won by Bafana Bafana.
