JOHANNESBURG - The South African Sevens side retained their World Sevens Series crown in dramatic fashion, when they beat England in the final of the Paris leg of the series on Sunday to overhaul Fiji and claim the title. Fiji went into the final tournament of the series with a 7-point lead and after they stumbled against England in the quarterfinals, it opened the door for SA, who were required to win the Cup final to surpass them and claim the title. A shaky quarterfinal against Spain was followed by a strong semifinal win over New Zealand and eventually a final victory over England, winning 24-14 to claim only their second tournament victory of the 2017/2018 series. Fiji claimed five tournament wins. It is the first time in the history of the series that the overall champions were decided on the last match of the last day.
