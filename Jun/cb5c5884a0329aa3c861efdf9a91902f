CAPE TOWN - Law enforcement officers are keeping a close eye on the volatile situation in Hout Bay where taxi drivers are demonstrating. The drivers who are affiliated to Cape Amalgamated Taxi Associations (Cata) claim the City of Cape Town has been allowing the Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) to operate on their routes illegally. The SA Police Serviceâ€™ Public Order Police have been moving further down Victoria Road towards Imizamo Yethu to move the group of protesters back.  Stun grenades were used earlier in a bid to disperse demonstrators who'd been blocking roads with large rocks and debris. It's a tense standoff between officers and protesters with both sides watching the other. A police helicopter has also been circling above the area where the protesters are gathered. Taxi drivers want City of Cape Town transport officials to meet with them to discuss Codeta, apparently operating on their routes without permits. So far, no city officials have been here.
