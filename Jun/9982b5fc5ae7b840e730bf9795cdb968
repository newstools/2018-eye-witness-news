The match is of significant importance as it will be Tendai Mtawarira's 100th Test match in a Springbok jersey, and it will also coincide with captain Siya Kolisi's 27th Birthday. BLOEMFONTEIN - Rassie Erasmus  made two changes to the Springboks starting side for the second Test match against England at the Toyota Stadium in Bloemfontein on Saturday. Lock Pieter-Steph du Toit will start at blindside flank in place of Jean-Luc du Preez, while tighthead prop Frans Malherbe returns from a neck injury to start in place of Wilco Louw  who reverts to the bench. Jesse Kriel  comes on to the bench to provide backline cover, replacing flyhalf Elton Jantjies who falls out of the matchday 23 completely. The match is of significant importance as it will be Tendai Mtawarira's 100th Test match in a Springbok jersey, and it will also coincide with captain Siya Kolisi's 27th birthday. Springbok coach Erasmus says that the Boks must try and channel the emotion around Mtawarira's milestone in a positive way. "It is a massive achievement for the Beast. He has been around a long time and has worked extremely hard. I think we must also try and use the emotion around Beast's 100th Test in a positive way and not let it make us lose focus on the job at hand. "Last week it was a big day for Siya and he handled it very well, he was focused on the job and you could see him struggle in the last few minutes because he gave it his all last week and we expect the same from him and Beast this weekend also." The Boks have an opportunity to clinch the three-Test series in Bloemfontein ahead of the last Test match at Newlands in Cape Town next week. Kick-off at the Toyota Stadium is at 17:05 on Saturday.
