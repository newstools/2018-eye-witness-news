The Lower South Coast and Harry Gwala regions are also expected to follow suit. DURBAN - African National Congress (ANC) branches from the Moses Mabhida region are on their way to the Pietermaritzburg High Court to file an urgent court interdict to stop this weekend’s provincial conference. The Lower South Coast and Harry Gwala regions are also expected to follow suit. They claim the conference cannot go ahead until their grievances related to gatekeeping, parallel branches and bogus members are dealt with. Ward 25 branch member Zanele Sithole and others from the Moses Mabhida region are on their way to file the urgent court interdict. She says there are outstanding issues that the ANC needs to resolve. “The gatekeeping, there’s still that problem. And the BTMs themselves were not properly conducted.” Sithole says they aren’t satisfied with the ANC’s appeals committee. “The appeals committee actually attempted to come here but we felt that process should not proceed because we thought there are ulterior motives. They were just doing this compliance because they wanted to say they’re done with the appeals and done with the process and now we can continue with the conference.” Meanwhile, a delegation national ANC has officiated over the preparations for the KZN provincial conference which is expected to get underway later on Friday.
