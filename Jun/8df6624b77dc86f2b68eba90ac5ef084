JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Solidarity  has declared a dispute with Eskom  after the power utility allegedly failed to pitch for wage negotiations. Last week, the utility said it decided not to increase the wages of any workers, including those in management, in a bid to rein in costs. Solidarity intends to hand over memoranda at several Eskom workplaces in the coming week. Deputy general secretary Deon Reyneke says Eskom was reckless in the way it negotiated, and solidarity is calling on Eskom to come up with a new offer for employees without delay.
