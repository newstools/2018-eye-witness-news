DA officials will visit the Southern Cape town on Friday after mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies had to stepped down after losing a no confidence motion this week. CAPE TOWN – Democratic Alliance (DA) leaders have some more damage control to do, this time in the Knynsa municipality. DA officials will visit the Southern Cape town on Friday after mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies had to step down after losing a no confidence motion this week. The Democratic Alliance’s Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela has described it as a coup. LISTEN: DA to deal with #KnysnaMayor issue  During a special council sitting, Bouw-Spies was uprooted as mayor of the Southern Cape town. The DA’s Mark Willemse is now mayor, with the Congress of the People’s Ricky van Aswegen his deputy. Madikizela says officials want to know why DA councillors sided with the opposition during the motion against Bouw-Spies. “No matter what reason they had, what we find unacceptable is the fact that they went ahead and did this without consulting the leadership of the party.” African National Congress (ANC) councillors tabled the motion against Bouw-Spies, saying she had not performed her duties. The Knysna council comprises 10 members from the DA and seven from the ANC, with single seats for the Congress of the People (Cope), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and the Knysna Unity Congress.
